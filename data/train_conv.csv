0,1,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Germany!

Just the person I want to speak with. I have a somewhat crazy idea that I‚Äôve always wanted to try with I/G, but I‚Äôve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what‚Äôs worse, it might make you suspicious of me. 

So...do I suggest it?

I‚Äôm thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That‚Äôs my hope anyway.

What is your appetite like for unusual and crazy?",True,True,0
1,1,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"You've whet my appetite, Italy. What's the suggestion?",True,True,0
2,1,1901,Spring,italy,germany,üëç,True,True,0
3,1,1901,Spring,germany,italy,It seems like there are a lot of ways that could go wrong...I don't see why France would see you approaching/taking Munich--while I do nothing about it--and not immediately feel skittish,True,True,0
4,1,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Yeah, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve tried it and it works, cause I‚Äôve never tried it or seen it. But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we‚Äôre really at war and you‚Äôre going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France.

All that said, I‚Äôve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I‚Äôm not offended or concerned if it‚Äôs just not for you. I‚Äôm happy to play more conventionally too. Up to you.",NOANNOTATION,True,0
5,1,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"I am just sensing that you don‚Äôt like this idea, so shall we talk about something else? That was just a crazy idea I‚Äôve always wanted to try. I‚Äôm happy to play more conservatively.",NOANNOTATION,True,0
6,1,1901,Spring,italy,germany,Any thoughts?,NOANNOTATION,True,0
7,1,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"Sorry Italy I've been away doing, um, German things. Brewing Lagers?",True,True,0

9,1,1901,Spring,italy,germany,I am pretty conflicted about whether to guess that you were telling the truth or lying about the ‚Äúbrewing lagers‚Äù thing. I am going to take it literally and say üëé even though I don‚Äôt think you meant it deceptively. üòâ,True,True,0
10,1,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"But I think I can get over ‚ÄúLagergate‚Äù and we can still be friends. 

As of right now, I think Austria may be my most reliable ally. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôd like to play as a Central Trio if you have any interest in that. Thoughts?",True,True,0
11,1,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"We haven't even passed a season yet and you have a 'most reliable ally'?

I'll consider this proposal but, basically, I'm not going to expose myself to risk from either of you until I've seen a bit of your behavior",True,True,0
12,1,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Well, at least I have an idea of who to trust. Obviously, my ideas are subject to change. 

I understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance. 

If you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match. 

I‚Äôm looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.",True,True,0
13,1,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Just an FYI: I‚Äôve now had both England and France suggest to me that I should move to Tyrolia and France will support me to Munich in the Fall. One saying that to me is not a big deal, but with both mentioning it, my alarm bells are going off. I am concerned about an E/F. 

I‚Äôm certainly not moving to Tyrolia. But I just want you to be cautious here. I feel like England and France are working together.",True,True,0
14,1,1901,Fall,germany,italy,"I appreciate the tip, but I'm wondering why you're so against ousting me from Munich if I haven't explicitly agreed to be your ally?",True,True,0
15,1,1901,Fall,italy,germany,"Because it is terrible, terrible play for Italy to attack Germany, in my view. If I were to attack you in Munich, I could never hold Munich. So, all I would be doing is weakening you, and helping France, England, or both to get really big. 

I don‚Äôt have any long-term path going north. Helping France to take you down is a sucker‚Äôs play, whether you are working with me or not.",NOANNOTATION,True,0
16,1,1901,Fall,italy,germany,"Did France tell you he was moving to Burgundy, or was that a stab?",True,True,0
17,1,1901,Fall,germany,italy,"I was not informed of it, no. And England is leading me to believe it's part of a play for Belgium, so if they're working together this might be a trick...

Italy, you seem like a straight shooter, and Austria has confirmed with me about your two's alliance. So I'll confide in you--this is my first ever game of diplomacy, and I think that teaming up with the two of you could help me learn more and have more fun. So, if you're still interested in a central powers alliance, I'm in.",True,True,0
18,1,1901,Fall,germany,italy,"Okay full disclosure: I'm not very smart, and I accidentally let slip to England that you told me France was plotting to take Munich. I'm sorry for the error but I figured it was better to admit it so you know that England/France may not trust you.",True,True,0

22,1,1901,Winter,germany,italy,What would you think of helping me take Marseilles in two turns?,True,True,1
23,1,1901,Winter,italy,germany,"Hi Germany, I‚Äôll certainly consider that. Though, I‚Äôll note: traditionally, Germany would help Italy to Marseilles if the two of them work together there. The reason is that: if I help you to Marseilles, I‚Äôm basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself. So, usually, Germany would help Italy into Marseilles to encourage Italy to come west and Germany would plan to take Paris, Belgium and Brest.",True,True,-1
24,1,1901,Winter,germany,italy,"Fair enough--I'll help you take it, then, but I'll need to deal with Belgium first.",True,True,1
25,1,1901,Winter,italy,germany,How are things going with England? I think that getting him to work with you is the main key here.,True,True,-1
26,1,1902,Spring,germany,italy,I'm trying--I just offered to assist with taking Sweden in exchange for some assistance into Belgium...not sure if they'll go for it...,True,True,1
27,1,1902,Spring,italy,germany,I‚Äôll check with England and try to see where his head is at.,True,True,-1
28,1,1902,Spring,germany,italy,I've actually been thinking about this game all day üòÖ  and have come up with a plan I like a bit better... but England still hasn't responded to my initial offer.,NOANNOTATION,True,1
29,1,1902,Spring,italy,germany,"That‚Äôs the worst!

And I‚Äôm glad to see you‚Äôre so focused on this in your first game. It‚Äôs a really great game if you put in the time and effort!",True,True,-1
30,1,1902,Spring,germany,italy,You're definitely telling the truth on that one. So can I count on you to move to piedmont this season?,True,True,1
31,1,1902,Spring,italy,germany,"I don‚Äôt think I can afford to move to Piedmont this season. I don‚Äôt really trust Austria to avoid walking through that door if I leave it wide open. 

I think you need to get England on board to attack France.",True,True,-1
32,1,1902,Spring,germany,italy,"That's valid. And actually I was conferring with England and we concluded that it's not really gonna be possible for me to help you take Marseilles this year anyway. 

...what are you and Austria planning for this year, then? I'm willing to tell you my plans in exchange as a gesture of trust. 

Have you communicated at all with England or France?",True,True,1
33,1,1902,Spring,italy,germany,"Hi, are you there?

Just woke up. 

England did return my message, but he did not tell me anything substantive so I really don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing. I‚Äôm planning to move towards Turkey.",True,True,-1
34,1,1902,Spring,italy,germany,"Well, you‚Äôre in trouble. That England move is trouble. 

I‚Äôm going to try to convince him to change course. I suggest you be very kind to him, and don‚Äôt burn that bridge. I think your game hinges on turning England around.",True,True,-1
35,1,1902,Fall,italy,germany,"Hi Germany,

I‚Äôm working hard on turning England. And I‚Äôm also trying to get Russia to come to your aid. Doing the best I can! I‚Äôll keep you posted.",True,True,-1
36,1,1902,Fall,germany,italy,"England just told me that Russia is helping them to take Denmark so that may be a lost cause. Granted, the source for that intel is a serpentine jackal-spawn",True,True,1
37,1,1903,Spring,italy,germany,"Okay, I‚Äôm reasonably sure that England wants to take the Channel and attack France now. 

I believe that you should basically do whatever England asks to help make this happen. As long as E attacks F, you will be in a much better position, and you‚Äôll gain back centers quickly. 

What are you hearing?",True,True,1
38,1,1903,Fall,germany,italy,"What are your plans for this turn? I can't help but notice that Munich is surrounded by foreign armies on three sides...

40,1,1903,Fall,italy,germany,"I have good news! (1) I am finally attacking France this turn. (2) I will be supporting Munich to hold from Tyrolia. 

Let‚Äôs turn this game around, yes?",True,True,1
41,1,1903,Fall,italy,germany,I am pretty sure that England is not attacking you this turn. And I am committed to supporting Munich holding. Make sure you don‚Äôt move Munich so that it can take my support.,True,True,1
42,1,1903,Fall,germany,italy,"Okay, can do. Thanks!",True,True,-1
43,1,1903,Fall,italy,germany,"I suggest that you order:
Kiel Support Berlin holding
Berlin Support Munich holding
Helg to Holland
Munich Support Berlin holding",True,True,1
44,1,1903,Fall,germany,italy,I agree completely--although I didn't know that a country could hold *and* support at the same time! Thanks!,True,True,-1
45,1,1903,Fall,germany,italy,Thanks Italy. Hope you're enjoying the weather on the Anatolian üòâ,True,True,-1
46,1,1904,Spring,italy,germany,I will be supporting Munich to hold again. And I‚Äôll be trying to get Russia to back off your flank and protect himself against an Austrian stab that is coming.,NOANNOTATION,True,2
47,1,1904,Spring,italy,germany,"Two bits of advice: #1 I suggest you tell Russia that Austria is coming for him. You really want Russia to move Sil back to Gal. You might also suggest to Russia that is he supports you to Denmark, you will then support Russia back to Sweden. I don‚Äôt know yet if it actually makes sense to do that, but you want Russia thinking that you are eager to work with him.

48,1,1904,Spring,italy,germany,"#2 Here is the move set I would suggest right now:
Kiel Support Holland holding
Holland Support Wales to Belgium (tell England you are going to order this support and he can take it or leave it)
Munich Support Berlin holding
Berlin Support Munich holding

I think that both France and Russia are about to back off you, as they are both under fire at home. Just hold still, and soon you should be able to break out of this holding pattern.",NOANNOTATION,True,2
49,1,1904,Spring,germany,italy,"God, I hope so! I'm attempting to make that deal with russia now...and I'm talking with England re: Belgium",True,True,-2
50,1,1904,Spring,italy,germany,"It‚Äôs none of my business, but if you do plan to take Denmark, I strongly recommend you wait until Fall. I think the most important thing for you right now is getting England fully committed against France. If that happens, taking Denmark later will be easy.",True,True,2
51,1,1904,Spring,germany,italy,"I think me and England are really on the same page at this point regarding France. I'm actually sort of running counter-intelligence for England (and my friends to the south, of course!) with Russia right now. 

England and I talked about Denmark too...and it seems like one or the other of Denmark or Belgium should work out for me this year and I'm fine with that",True,True,-2
52,1,1904,Spring,italy,germany,Great to hear. Thank you.,True,True,2
53,1,1904,Fall,germany,italy,"Do you need me to disrupt Bur this year? I'll need to seriously trust Russia if I'm going to risk not holding my eastern front, I think...",True,True,-2
54,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,"I do think a move to Burgundy makes sense for you this turn, and I can‚Äôt imagine Russia attacking you here. He has a serious Austria problem. 

I suggest this:
Mun - Bur
Ruh - Bel
Hol Support Ruh - Bel 
Ber - Kie

Tell Russia that the last thing in the world you want to see is Austria run him over, and you‚Äôre willing to help keep Russia viable if necessary (you‚Äôre angling for Russia to disband his northern holdings this turn).",True,True,2
55,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,"And ask England nicely to support Ruh - Hol, with the explanation that you don‚Äôt plan to ask for Denmark back, but you think it would help you both to diminish France.

56,1,1904,Fall,germany,italy,"Thanks, I'll work on these. 
...Why didn't you scooch into the Aegean behind Austria? You could have defended or even held Bulgaria this turn?",True,True,-2
57,1,1904,Fall,germany,italy,"England and I were talking about your moves for this season--what do you think of convoying Pie into Spa, supporting this with Wes, and then moving Tyr into Pie?",True,True,-2
58,1,1904,Fall,germany,italy,"This leaves Marseilles open for Bur to fall into if France goes that route, which gives me an opening into Bur",True,True,-2
59,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,That‚Äôs not bad.,True,True,2
60,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,I was kind of thinking I should pick one or the other of Marseilles or Spain to attack and not tell a soul which one I‚Äôm going after.,True,True,2
61,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,Do you really think it‚Äôs important to coordinate?,True,True,2
62,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,I do think you‚Äôre best off moving to Burgundy. And there is some chance that we fail this turn. But I think we just take a guess and hope for the best. We‚Äôll get him next turn if not this one.,True,True,2
63,1,1904,Fall,germany,italy,Okay‚Äîsorry for being nosy! I will try for bur on the off chance it shakes out that way,True,True,-2

65,1,1904,Fall,germany,italy,Marked as true,True,True,-2
66,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,"I like to coordinate, but on these sort of 50/50 guesses, I kind of like to keep it secret so that if it doesn‚Äôt go well, I have nobody to blame but myself.",True,True,2
67,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,Ha!,True,True,2
68,1,1904,Fall,germany,italy,"Well, are you willing to humor my question about the Aegean, anyway?",True,True,-2
69,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,"Sure. I was thinking of moving that fleet to Ionian. You think a move to Aegean is better? I‚Äôm not really sure, but let‚Äôs talk it through.",True,True,2
70,1,1904,Fall,germany,italy,"No sorry I meant in hindsight--like this past turn you should have moved to Aeg so that this current turn, when Austria takes Rumania (from Bulgaria), you'd be there to cover Bulgaria so it couldn't get scooped by the Black sea, and potentially you'd just get to take it.",True,True,-2
71,1,1904,Fall,italy,germany,Not a bad point. I agree.,True,True,2
72,1,1904,Winter,italy,germany,"Hmmmm, kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won‚Äôt hold it against you. You‚Äôre in a tough spot.",True,True,2
73,1,1904,Winter,germany,italy,um what lie? I did exactly the moves you suggested!,True,True,-2
74,1,1904,Winter,italy,germany,Ha! So sorry!! I meant that for France!,True,True,2
75,1,1904,Winter,italy,germany,You are my favorite.,False,True,2
76,1,1904,Winter,germany,italy,"Marked as lie because clearly austria is your favorite.
Speaking of, I assume that your seizing Trieste was mutually agreed upon?",True,True,-2
77,1,1904,Winter,italy,germany,Yes ‚Äî agreed upon.,True,True,2
78,1,1904,Winter,germany,italy,That's not what Austria said to England...,True,True,-2

80,1,1904,Winter,germany,italy,"You know italy, I think we *do* need to coordinate your move this time--England and I have a shot at either Bur or Mao if one of Marseilles or Spain can be left open for France to fall into. This will improve all of our chances of crushing France quickly.",True,True,-2
81,1,1904,Winter,italy,germany,"Okay, I can dig it. What do you want me to do?",True,True,2
82,1,1904,Winter,germany,italy,Let me confer with England and get back to you. Glad to hear that though!,True,True,-2
83,1,1905,Spring,italy,germany,So...any thoughts on how to approach this?,True,True,2
84,1,1905,Spring,germany,italy,"It looks like England's not willing to try for MAO if it means possibly losing the channel. However, they'll bring the NWG fleet around to try for MAO next year. 
So if you could keep Marseilles open, it will help me to try and take Burgundy this turn.",True,True,-2
85,1,1905,Spring,italy,germany,"If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)",True,True,2
86,1,1905,Spring,germany,italy,Will do.,True,True,-2
87,1,1905,Spring,germany,italy,"Okay, so I still have a teensy little bone to pick with you: on the off-chance that Austria wasn't lying and you *did* take Trieste unexpectedly, I sort of worry that I might be next. Are you willing to tell me what your plans are for the Tri unit, or at least to warn me before any move into Tyrolia?",True,True,-2
88,1,1905,Spring,italy,germany,"Sure. But, you‚Äôll see from my moves this turn that Austria is lying to you.",True,True,2
89,1,1905,Spring,italy,germany,I currently have Tri - Tyrolia. I like the unit there because it sets up an attack on Austria if I ever want to go that route (build A Ven and go east). Do you want me to keep Tyrolia clear?,True,True,2
90,1,1905,Spring,italy,germany,I‚Äôll add ‚Äî I would never attack Germany as Italy. Setting myself as a giant column like that is just not defensible. It would be a terrible move.,True,True,2
91,1,1905,Spring,germany,italy,Not when that column is not-so-giant and in a turf war with France.,True,True,-2
92,1,1905,Spring,germany,italy,oh you mean setting *yourself*,True,True,-2

94,1,1905,Spring,italy,germany,"I mean this sincerely: any Germany who does that is a terrible player. 

Why would I do that? I would need 2-3 units to hold one center. That is a net negative. And all of your units are doing things that are good for me in containing your neighbors. 

I‚Äôve been working hard in this game for you to succeed and knock back France and England. I can say with 100% certainty: I‚Äôm not going to attack you. I‚Äôm going to keep helping you as much as I can.",True,True,2

Your logic is undenyable‚Äî enjoy your stay in tyr!",True,True,-2
97,1,1905,Spring,germany,italy,*undeniable? That looks better,True,True,-2
98,1,1905,Spring,italy,germany,"I mean it sincerely. I think that England will want to coax me to attack you with him after France falls, but I‚Äôd much rather work with you against England. 

But first thing‚Äôs first ‚Äî let‚Äôs get rid of France.",True,True,2
99,1,1905,Spring,germany,italy,Agreed,True,True,-2
100,1,1905,Spring,germany,italy,(On the france part),True,True,-2
101,1,1905,Fall,germany,italy,Sorry I won't be able to cut off Gascony this turn...I probably should have just told you my moves; you could have advised me that supporting Mun-Bur was more important than Kie-Ruh,True,True,-2
102,1,1905,Fall,italy,germany,"No worries. We‚Äôll crack this but eventually. 

Here is my suggestion for this turn:
Kie - Den
Hol S Bel holding
Bel S Ruh - Bur
Mun S Ruh - Bur
Ruh - Bur",True,True,2
103,1,1905,Fall,italy,germany,"I think you should suggest to England that he gets Sweden and St Petersburg, while you get Denmark back. That‚Äôs only fair, as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against France and you plan to continue to do that.",True,True,2
104,1,1905,Fall,germany,italy,"The moves I had already planned differ in one respect: I thought it would be worth the risk to try moving Hol-Bel and therefore move Bel-Bur. Even if me and France are high-fiving in Bel for a few seasons it's still mine, and it's not like Holland has anything better to do while I'm still allies with England.

...The only reason I'm reluctant to make that agreement with England is that---while I think *you* and I have a good relationship---I really have not talked with Austria much at all, and I'm the next logical target for them when Russia's gone. And anything that's bad for Russia right now is good for Austria.",True,True,-2
105,1,1905,Fall,italy,germany,"Hmmmm, I‚Äôm just not sure you should trust England enough right now to leave Holland open and Belgium essentially unguarded. 

France is a really good player, and he is no doubt working hard to get England to turn on you. My personal take is that you are better off being a bit more conservative until you have Denmark back and England has moved another fleet towards France. But I can see it either way.",True,True,2
106,1,1905,Fall,italy,germany,"With regard to Russia, talk it through with England. What you don‚Äôt want is England taking out Russia and giving you nothing. So, if England agrees to let Russia be for a while, then your plan sounds good. But if England is going to take Sweden, you really should get Denmark back. (I‚Äôm my view)",True,True,2
107,1,1905,Fall,germany,italy,"Okay you've convinced me: it's worth figuring out what E's plans are for Russia at least.

And you're almost certainly right, from a rational perspective, about leaving Holland/Belgium vulnerable to England. But I think England really is counting on my assistance in taking France, and because of that and other non-quantifiable reasons I trust them.",True,True,-2
108,1,1905,Fall,italy,germany,"Excellent. Obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with England than I do. Just know that France is persuasive, and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs working on. He stopped talking to me, so I bet he‚Äôs trying to turn England. Just keep reassuring England that you want to work with him long-term so he doesn‚Äôt succumb to the Dark Side.",True,True,2
109,1,1905,Winter,italy,germany,"Hi Germany ‚Äî well, I think we‚Äôre getting to a critical point in the game here. France held out a long time, but he‚Äôs much less of a threat now. I think the critical issue, for you, is England. 

I have some thoughts on the matter, and some information, but I‚Äôd like to feel confident that you and I will keep anything we say between us. I think of you as the one person who has been honest with me on every turn. You even tell me the truth when it‚Äôs bad news, or when you don‚Äôt completely trust me, and I like that.",True,True,3
110,1,1905,Winter,germany,italy,"Okay, Italy. I won't share any of this conversation. But in the interest of continued full disclosure, here's what I think: England is a greater threat to *me* on the map, but *you* have a greater chance of soloing this game quickly, or pair-winning with Austria even sooner. And if I continue to collaborate with England, we at least have a chance of slowing that down. So I'm in sort of a conflicted spot",True,True,-3
111,1,1905,Winter,italy,germany,This is why I like you. The full disclosure part. You tell me the truth even when the news isn‚Äôt great.,True,True,3
112,1,1905,Winter,italy,germany,"My thoughts on the ‚ÄúGermany/England forever so that at least we can stop the solo‚Äù strategy: (1) It‚Äôs quite early to be talking about solos. I am at 8, and Austria could take 3 from me any time, quite easily. (2) I don‚Äôt think England is thinking that way. I think he‚Äôs thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north, and one will emerge in the south. And he‚Äôs like to be that dominant power.",True,True,3
113,1,1905,Winter,italy,germany,"England‚Äôs pieces are not positioned well if he‚Äôs trying to attack France or contain Italy. He keeps Denmark guarded, and North Sea filled. He is not playing like he intends to stick with you, even though I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs telling you that.",True,True,3

115,1,1905,Winter,italy,germany,"If I were you, this is what I would do: (1) keep warning England about the dangers of Italy getting too big and insist that England moves his fleets towards MAO (Channel to Irish, Norwegian to NAO, North - Channel), (2) insist on taking Denmark back.",True,True,3
116,1,1905,Winter,italy,germany,"I would say something like this:

England, I‚Äôm with you my friend, but we‚Äôre passed the stage of you needing to keep me under lock and key. I need to take Denmark back. I‚Äôm happy to support you to Brest to keep you growing, or you can grab Sweden.

117,1,1905,Winter,italy,germany,I am hearing from England signs that he may be thinking of attacking you soon. And I think you actually avoid that better by being strong and sticking up for yourself rather than being accommodating and letting him do whatever he wants to do.,True,True,3
118,1,1905,Winter,germany,italy,"Well, both you and France have now pointed out that England is strategically not in a good place to be my ally right now, and you are correct.

128,1,1906,Spring,germany,italy,England told me you said I was plotting with France. It makes sense you‚Äôd want to pit us against each other.,True,True,-3
129,1,1906,Spring,italy,germany,Hey ‚Äî tried to send you a message earlier but not was down. England was telling me that you‚Äôre saying that I told you that England is plotting against you. The problem with telling England that is that he will stop giving me useful info.,True,True,3

137,1,1906,Spring,germany,italy,"Yep, there's some sarcasm there. Looking back at your messages, I still don't read them as encouraging collaboration. And if you wanted us to be friends, you could have done that without betraying me to England by simply saying in your candid way ""I don't think you should do that for such and such reason"". But you chose to increase E's distrust of me. So I think you might be full of gnocchi and crap. 

My trust in you is a bit shaken but I still think we can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on my end. It would be my preference that you hold Mao, on the assumption that if it came down to a choice between partnering with me or England, you'd choose me. If that's not the case, then as the filling of an England-Italy sandwich I'm in no position to retaliate anyway.",True,True,-3

146,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,"So, if it comes down to you or him, I‚Äôm choosing you. And I‚Äôll work to do a better job of keeping your confidence. I certainly understand how important that is, as I hate it when people o that same thing to me.",True,True,3
147,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,So no more playing mediator for me.,True,True,3
148,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,Okay. Is it true that you want the channel?,True,True,-3
149,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,And are you planning to keep Vienna?,True,True,-3
150,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,I am not planning to keep Vienna. And yeah I‚Äôve asked France for support to the Channel. Do you think he‚Äôs on board?,True,True,3
151,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,I'm not sure. Is *England* on board? Is this something England can know about?,NOANNOTATION,True,-3

153,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,"France has asked my opinion on it, and I haven't given it yet. To my estimation things look a lot better for me if you don't end up there: I don't want to see England in Mao, and I don't want to see you snagging pieces of the north.",True,True,-3
154,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,"Okay, well, here is my thinking. Tell France whatever you want to make him happy. Then tell me how you really feel. And if you don‚Äôt want me to go there, I won‚Äôt go there.",True,True,3

156,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,"Absolutely. 

You and I have discussed our moves and been honest with each other every turn. But we have not been sharing all our moves or pre-clearing all of our moves.

157,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,"I kind of thought that you would have wanted me in the Channel because it commits me further against England, but I can understand what you‚Äôre saying now about wanting me to hang back.",True,True,3
158,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,"But I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with me contemplating moves without telling you all of them. You asked me about it, and I told you the truth.",True,False,3
159,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,"I do think that this move is a breach of general expectation, which is the kind of thing I'd like to know about. And it's also the kind of thing I've shared with you: case in point, my desire to stab England.",True,True,-3
160,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,Okay. Understood.,True,True,3
161,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,"Is there anything I could gain from seeing you in the channel? Would you support me taking Nth, and potentially seizing the island?",True,True,-3
162,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,"Here's what I'm thinking: I would be on board with you taking the channel (and I'd give France the green light to go ahead with it) if you would agree to bump Nao out of Mao using Wes, and if you'd be open to supporting some anti-English aggression while holding the channel so that I can get on equal footing with you, dot-wise.

If you don't want to agree to those terms, that's okay, but I would strongly prefer not to see you in the channel in that case.",True,True,-3
163,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,"I‚Äôm going to be out of pocket this weekend, so let‚Äôs talk this through more on Monday. Generally, I agree that I‚Äôll either stay out of the Channel or agree to your terms for entering there.",True,True,3
164,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,"If you decide to stay out of the channel, I have a deal that I like with England in the works. For that deal to go through, you'd have to agree to move Mao into Portugal to let England take Mao. Would you be amenable to that?",True,True,-3

167,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,"Well, when I initially proposed the deal I had forgotten that Portugal was promised to England. Then England agreed to it on the condition that you would confirm that move, so I figured E thought you would just move out of there next year? But now that I think about it, it‚Äôs probably worth asking England why they‚Äôd agree to that.",True,True,-3
168,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,I‚Äôd prefer that you not tell England I am considering moving to the Channel. I don‚Äôt think he would like that.,True,True,3

174,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,I haven't spoken to France since then. I didn't realize you were giving the two of us different information on this particular subject. But I don't think I've revealed anything to them about what you plan to do. Mostly because you haven't told me.,True,True,-3
175,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,"Well, I have been honest with both you and France. You told me that I need to promise you a set of things in order to take the Channel. I felt like it was more than I could be sure of doing, so I am not entering the Channel. I won‚Äôt go there without your permission.",True,False,3
176,1,1906,Fall,germany,italy,I appreciate that. And I'll keep the remainder of this conversation between us unless I hear otherwise. Have you just recently made an agreement with England?,True,True,-3

184,1,1906,Fall,italy,germany,I suggest you just not tell England anything about my moves.,True,True,3

203,1,1907,Spring,italy,germany,"Yeah, that is all along the lines of what I‚Äôm thinking. How demanding does France sound right now? Does he want to be the one who takes Brest?",True,True,3

Tyrolia is one of them and I think you knew that. And England *also* told me they've never told me a lie; I'm starting to think that's Diplomacy-speak for ""when convenient, I've used careful wording and half-truths to deceive you even when everything I said was technically true"". 

It would help me to know that you see me being a benefit to you beyond taking out England. A natural next move for us would be to take out russia, and in that arena I have a positional advantage over you.

And if England were to reach out to you, you're too smart to just snub them. There's advantage to be gained--either for both of us or just for yourself--from talking to them. The only reason I stopped was because I knew my word would be mud to them anyway.

Earlier I was hoping you'd give me the truth about what you knew, and about what they might know. But you didn't and that both disappoints and scares me. So I'm asking that you give me just a modicum of honesty here: what do you know? what does England know?",True,True,-3

...and here's the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you've been sneaky and you've always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so *easy* to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. 

I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over.

727,1,1905,Fall,england,italy,"I'd bet russia is already planning to do this, but I can make the suggestion",True,True,-2
728,1,1905,Fall,england,italy,I did have a different move for Tyr in mind.,True,True,-2
729,1,1905,Fall,italy,england,Oh yeah?,True,True,2
730,1,1905,Fall,england,italy,"This is not a good idea, i should clarify. But it would be very dramatic if you successfully supported Boh to Mun",True,True,-2
731,1,1905,Fall,england,italy,(also I have a feeling russia won't be online before noon unfortunately),True,True,-2
732,1,1905,Fall,england,italy,"well, russia had the right idea, but didn't choose the right one to support. Bounce in Ank planned? And congrats on Mar",True,True,-2
733,1,1905,Fall,italy,england,"Yes, both bounces planned. Russia made a nice gamble taking Bulgaria.",True,True,2
734,1,1905,Fall,england,italy,Even with Austria in BLA now? I'll be a little annoyed if I see a build in St. P,True,True,-2
735,1,1905,Fall,italy,england,"Yeah, for sure. Austria loses that build and keeps Vienna vacant. Russia GETS a build. Yeah, I think that worked well for Russia.",True,True,2
736,1,1905,Winter,england,italy,"We should start talking about the France endgame and what things look like post-war. Maybe after we see the French choice for a disband. I think France hates me the most (despite me having taken none of his territories) and as a result will probably hold onto Brest until the end, or maybe even go for LVP or something.",True,True,-3
737,1,1905,Winter,italy,england,Sure ‚Äî I‚Äôm happy to talk it through. That move by France to bounce NAO was annoying.,True,True,3
738,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,"Yeah, I kinda saw that coming. So things are kinda escalating with germany. She‚Äôs making lots of asks that I don‚Äôt think are reasonable. Like ‚Äúwhy not just give me denmark‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy not just leave Nth open‚Äù. She‚Äôs also admitted to being friendly with France.",True,True,-3
739,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"Yeah, I‚Äôm hearing rumblings of the same thing from Germany. Just sort of feeling me out on whether I‚Äôd be okay with her working with France. Not good.",True,True,3
740,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,How would you like to address it with moves this turn? Do you want me to support you to MAO? Or should I move there?,True,True,3
741,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,"How has she suggested to you that she‚Äôll be helping France? Because if she‚Äôs telling you that, it must mean working with france against me, maybe with something specific in mind. She also wants me to give up Brest haha. Maybe i‚Äôll ask if she wants London",True,True,-3
742,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,I don‚Äôt know anything specific. She‚Äôs just asking for my thoughts. I have not responded.,True,False,3
743,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"Though, I‚Äôm not surprised. France is not going to quit. He hasn‚Äôt been talking to me anymore and he hasn‚Äôt been trying to turn you. That means he‚Äôs been working on Germany. I think we just have to keep telling her that France is a Dark Wizard who does not have her best interest in mind.",True,True,3
744,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,"Yeah, I mean good on France for being persistent. I'm sure France is telling her that we're allies. And that would actually be the truth. And just geographically it would be hard for me and germany to be allies longer-term, so it's somewhat understandable that Germany could be swayed by that logic.",True,True,-3
745,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,What are your thoughts on the timing of war with Germany (if you're keen on a war in the near future at all)? I have an idea of how to handle the situation that's slightly dependent on that,True,True,-3
746,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"Well, I don‚Äôt really want to attack Germany this year. In a perfect world, you and I each get a build this year, and we are in position to attack Germany next year.",True,True,3
747,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"Germany seems to like my advice, so I may be able to get her to take Paris this year and refrain from attacking you. If we can cripple France in the next two turns, without Germany attacking, then next year‚Äôs attack on Germany would be easy.",True,True,3
748,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,That is my general thinking in it.,True,True,3
749,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,"I mean I don't see how I get a build this year outside of moving in on Russia, but I'd rather stay out for now. Honestly the worst that Germany can do this year is knock me out of the channel.",True,True,-3
750,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,So I don't want support into MAO this turn. I might reach out to France with a proposition for survival that I won't follow through with. But maybe I can make it convincing enough that he gives it a shot. Otherwise I'm rather nervous that France gives Germany a big hand with attacking my island in his final years,True,True,-3
751,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,"Also, will an attack on Germany really be easy next year?",True,True,-3
752,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,"Also, did you tell germany i was plotting against her? She says you did.",True,True,-3
753,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"Whoa ‚Äî no, I want you and Germany to work together.",False,False,3
754,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"I would not and have not said you are plotting against her. She floated the ‚Äúwork with France thing,‚Äù and I suggested that she should really take Paris now while she can.",False,False,3
755,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"If we can get Germany to take Paris, next year will be much easier. I think we should both direct her there.",NOANNOTATION,True,3
756,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,"You really said nothing to that effect? What would prompt france to say that to me? It‚Äôs ok if you did say something, but i want you to be honest about it.",True,True,-3
757,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,Some exciting moves. Will be curious to see where you stand.,True,True,-3
758,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"Hey ‚Äî sorry I‚Äôve been offline since the bot went down. That looks like a pretty aggressive move from Germany. I wonder if France has pocketed her. I do like the move to Paris, but the rest is not good.",True,True,3
759,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,Yeahh. It‚Äôs a shame. I mean i‚Äôm aware at this point that the two of you could choose to mow over me. I hope the expanse in northern russia makes you wary of helping germany though.,True,True,-3
760,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,Time for survival mode. Will appreciate some advice on tactics if you‚Äôre on my side of this.,True,True,-3
761,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"Yeah, I‚Äôm on your side. I‚Äôll help on tactics, but I think the real key here is getting Germany to flip back. I don‚Äôt see why that move has to be permanent. I think you should tell her something like this: ‚ÄúLook, I see that you are attacking you, but I think it‚Äôs my fault not yours. I should have given you back Denmark. I see that now. And I‚Äôm sorry. I will move out peaceably, and I hope we can work out a new working relationship.‚Äù",True,True,3
762,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"Just say you‚Äôre sorry. She can take it back anyway, might as well offer it back right?",True,True,3
763,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"(And I‚Äôm not saying you have anything to be sorry for, I‚Äôm just trying to brainstorm about what will help you turn her back to your side.)",True,True,3
764,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,"I already responded non-angrily, though not specifically what you said. I think a return of denmark could go a long way. Though that border will make things tense, and i don‚Äôt think peace with her could last forever",True,True,-3
765,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,One thing I'm curious about: Why would you want Germany and I to be friends? Aren't you better off with both of us fighting? And I can keep Denmark this fall if I give up the channel (which may fall anyways),True,True,-3
766,1,1906,Spring,italy,england,"Well, I want to be rid of France. I‚Äôve really been depending on the two of you to help in that project. If England decides to move out of Paris for France, that‚Äôs bad for me. 

Also, I don‚Äôt want to see Germany get two builds this turn. But you‚Äôre right, if it‚Äôs inevitable anyway, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. 

#teamengland",True,False,3
767,1,1906,Spring,england,italy,I sure hope you‚Äôve not been clicking that thumbs down haha. It would be a brutal stab. I suppose i‚Äôve got to place my trust somewhere though. Why choose me instead of germany?,True,True,-3
768,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,"You know, if you're able to lend a hand from MAO, I'm actually not in THAT bad of shape. Can I depend on that?",True,True,-3
769,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"1) You‚Äôve been straight with me all game. 2) You have a much better ability to read the board than she does. 3) You‚Äôre on the other side, so you can‚Äôt really stab me, but I could totally see her moving to Tyrolia some time soon. 4) You‚Äôre not in France‚Äôs pocket.",True,False,3
770,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,"All good reasons. Also, I think Germany is gonna ghost me, soooo, friends? I need MAO to attack Bre. Can you do that?",True,True,-3
771,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"I will ensure that Brest can‚Äôt hurt you. Not sure yet if I‚Äôll cut that support or get France to do something weird with it, but you can consider that unit non functional this turn. I‚Äôll also see what intel I can gain.",True,True,3
772,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,Cool. You really think you can get france to take your advice on Brest?,True,True,-3
773,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,And do you have opinions about russia walking into Mun?,True,True,-3
774,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"Re Brest: if I‚Äôm not confident, I‚Äôll just cut that support. I know that one is important to you, and I‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs taken care of.",True,True,3
775,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"Re Munich: that one never really crossed my mind. But if you can get Russia to do that, it would be awesome. I don‚Äôt want to see Germany get builds here.",True,True,3
776,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,"Cool. Any advice on the rest of tactics for my defense? I have my own ideas, but would be curious to hear your opinion",True,True,-3
777,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,I‚Äôd probably just use the army to protect Liverpool. I‚Äôd send NAO to Norwegian if the battle is going to be against Germany. And I‚Äôd flip a coin between supporting Channel to Belgium or supporting Denmark holding.,True,True,3
778,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,And I wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone the result of that coin flip. There is just no reason to share that info.,True,True,3
779,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,Huh. That's way different than what I had in mind.,True,True,-3
780,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"Well, you‚Äôre closer to it than I am. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve taken a much harder look. What am I missing?",True,True,3
781,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,"You're not missing anything, but I had a more defensive strategy in mind I guess. I've got some time to think it over. Please do let me know what intel you receive",True,True,-3
782,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,"Hi, I have a different ask of the MAO unit actually, if you're around this morning.",True,True,-3
783,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,Hey ‚Äî what‚Äôs up?,True,True,3
784,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,I want to see whether supporting channel to Bre is an option for MAO you'd consider. And I'd also want to know if Gas support will be cut.,True,True,-3
785,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"Well, have to just be honest here ‚Äî I‚Äôve been working on a larger plan considering your earlier request that I neutralize Brest, and I‚Äôm not sure that change works in the larger scheme.",True,True,3
786,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"More broadly, is there any chance you‚Äôd like to form a trio and work with me and Russia long term?",True,False,3
787,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,Why wouldn't you let me in on your larger plan?,True,True,-3
788,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,"And does your larger plan include neutralizing Brest, or did it just consider that I asked that? Can you confirm you're neutralizing Brest by attacking it from MAO?",True,True,-3
789,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"Yes, hitting Brest. 

I prefer not to share my moves if they don‚Äôt matter to someone else. There is just less chance that something goes wrong, and less chance I end up blaming someone else if something goes wrong.",True,True,3
790,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,What do you think about E/I/R as a trio?,True,False,3
791,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,"I think you need to justify to me why supporting into Brest isn't an option. I don't see how this could be relevant to some larger plan. Unless the plan is ""don't give England that build, don't show others that I'm supporting England""",True,True,-3
792,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"Wow. Well, you asked me to do something else earlier, and I have spent days trying to fit your earlier request into my move set.",True,True,3
793,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"But, you know what, it‚Äôs more important to me to have you as an ally. So I‚Äôll support you to Brest.",True,True,3
794,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,I obviously would like that. But to be honest I care less about the support and more about the secret.,NOANNOTATION,True,-3
795,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"So, confirmed, MAO supporting Channel to Brest.",True,True,3
796,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,Test.,True,False,3
797,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,It‚Äôs not a secret. It‚Äôs just that I like to keep my moves secret unless they matter to someone.,True,False,3
798,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,Can you confirm whether support from Gas is cut as well?,True,True,-3
799,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,I am not currently cutting support in Gascony.,True,True,3
800,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,Ok. And I'm down to chat about russian relations after the move. Sorry for the last-minute change here. But germany's been putting pressure on me,True,True,-3
801,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,Have to say ‚Äî I expect Germany to use Paris to support Brest. Those two seem to be in lockstep now.,True,True,3
802,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,Are you sure that I should just take Portugal to drop England down to 1 unit?,True,True,3
803,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,I mean drop France down to 1 unit.,True,True,3
804,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,"France is just going to bounce you out, right? What else does it make sense for the Spa unit to do?",True,True,-3
805,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"He thinks I am supporting an attack on Spain and moving to Burgundy, so I think his moves look like this:

Spain hold
Gas S Spa holding
Paris S Brest
Brest S MAO - Channel (he asked me to take it)
Irish - Liv",True,True,3
806,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,"Hmm, yeah I would have thought he would assume the Gas support would be cut. Does France really hate you the least?",True,True,-3
807,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"Yeah, I think France trusts that I‚Äôm actually going to Channel and Burgundy here.",True,True,3
808,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,I will admit I've communicated with Germany about your plan to use MAO to help me. That may have made its way back to France,NOANNOTATION,True,-3

810,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,Yeahh. I maybe should keep my mouth shut more often.,True,True,-3
811,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"Germany says that the Brest thing relates to Denmark. 

Anyway, what should we do?",True,True,3
812,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,It does. I'm giving up denmark for support to Brest.,True,True,-3
813,1,1906,Fall,italy,england,"Okay, I‚Äôll support you to Brest.",True,True,3
814,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,Sounds great,True,True,-3
815,1,1906,Fall,england,italy,Thanks,True,True,-3
816,1,1906,Winter,england,italy,Glad to see that go through.,True,True,-5
817,1,1906,Winter,england,italy,Told you about the move to Por btw,True,True,-5
818,1,1906,Winter,italy,england,You were right. Thank you.,True,True,5
819,1,1906,Winter,england,italy,"Well I'm glad to see the takedown work out. I suppose France has one more unit, but Por will fall next year. And now things get even more interesting. Signing off for now.",True,True,-5
820,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Hmmm, interesting French disband. He wants me to support him to Brest. Have to believe he‚Äôs going to have Germany on his side given the German fleet build. 

Thoughts on how to approach this? We should be able to defeat them if we stick together.",True,False,5
821,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"I think we should focus on getting your army to Pic this turn, and I can support you to Paris in the Fall.",True,False,5
822,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"DO NOT DISCUSS PLANS WITH GERMANY THIS TURN. Seems very clear that she‚Äôs coming for you based on the build and the French disband.

825,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"I'll be in communication with Germany, but I'll agree to not share any specific plans discussed between the two of us this turn. Is that fair?",True,True,-5
826,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,Yes of course. I don‚Äôt mean that you shouldn‚Äôt talk to her at all.,True,True,5
827,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"At first glance, I prefer an alliance with Russia, though I understand this means you breaking a relationship with Austria. Mostly this is because Russia can threaten me if he ever goes north. What's your preference?",True,True,-5
828,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Well, that‚Äôs fine with me. I like Russia. But here is the downside for you: if Russia grows, the north won‚Äôt be undefended any more, and you will have less room to grow. So, think long term, and think about where your dots are going to come from. I mean it sincerely when I say that I‚Äôll join up with either one provided you feel good about it, but I actually think it might be better for you if I give back Austria a couple of centers and position you to grab Swe and STP once Germany is on her heels.",True,False,5
829,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,Those are good points. I suppose you'd like to commit to this before moves this evening?,True,True,-5

833,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"How is Germany treating you right now? Did she tell you about that fleet build before it happened? Seems like a bad sign, and North Sea is awfully exposed.",True,True,5
834,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Oh she told me that she plans to line the whole northwest coast with fleets because ""they're more versatile there"". But all they can do from the northwest coast is invade me.",True,True,-5
835,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,She also said she wants Brest eventually.,True,True,-5
836,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,Not sure if I can keep Nth this year. We'll see if I can keep it friendly. That involves lots of talk about moving against you. She wants to see me in MAO.,True,True,-5
837,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Yeah, look, I don‚Äôt mind if you tell her that you‚Äôre moving against me. I am telling her that I‚Äôm moving against you. 

Let‚Äôs please make the following deal: You and I both plot with Germany as if we‚Äôre attacking each other. And we both share the plan with Germany against the other guy with each other, and we pledge to tell Germany (and France if he asks) that you and I are not talking much, we don‚Äôt trust each other, and we don‚Äôt have any plan in place.",True,True,5

841,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"And I think Austria is the ally we choose. If we hold off Germany, she can only expand into Russia, which would be her only friend. And the trusting relationship you have makes it more likely that things will go through.",True,True,-5

Pic - Channel
Spa - Gas
Par S Sap - Gas
MAO - Irish",True,False,5

Bre S Wal - Pic
Wal - Pic
Channel Convoy Wal - Pic

865,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,France wants me to go for MAO. I'm going to say I'm on board with that. I'll say NAO is going there.,True,True,-5
866,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,I mean germany,True,True,-5
867,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,Yep. That makes sense. She wants Edi and Norway clear.,True,True,5
868,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Also, does it matter so much if Germany is mad at both of us? Isn't it basically war in the Fall?",True,True,-5
869,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"If I were you, I‚Äôd order NAO to Norwegian. From Norwegian, you have a play to defend Norway AND Edi. Which means you could retreat to Helg if you like and you have a 50/50 to defend Norway or Edi.",True,False,5
870,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,Yeah that's what I'll order,True,True,-5
871,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Re G being mad: it‚Äôs not the end of the world. I mean, we‚Äôll definitely be at war with her. I just don‚Äôt want her trying to throw the game in spite or anything like that. Cause I am lying to her like crazy this turn. ü§≠ü§´",True,False,5
872,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,yeahh... it happens. i've been fortunate to not really have to lie so far.,True,True,-5
873,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,What are your thoughts on Mun?,True,True,-5
874,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Also, just out of curiosity, did you advise Germany to build the Kiel fleet?",True,True,-5
875,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,I absolutely did not advise G to build the F Kie.,True,True,5
876,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,We did not talk at all about that build.,True,True,5
877,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,Thoughts on Mun? What do you mean?,True,True,5
878,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"If G would have asked, I would have said that two armies would make me a bit uncomfortable, but I would not have insisted on a fleet, as two armies would have been more anti-Russian than anything. But she did not ask me.",True,True,5
879,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"I believe you. I just was curious. And I didn't look closely enough at Mun. Ber can just support. But I thought it might be interesting to work with Russia there, even if Russia isn't the long-term ally.",True,True,-5
880,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Also, who does germany think the third ally is?",True,True,-5
881,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,I ask because we may be interested to know whether Germany will try to sneak into Swe or not.,True,True,-5
882,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Well, I‚Äôm not next to Munich now, so there isn‚Äôt much I can do about that. Maybe in the Fall.",True,False,5
883,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,Germany and I have not discussed a third ally. She doesn‚Äôt give the impression that she cares much about the east.,True,True,5
884,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"I guess the question in spring is whether you move to Tyr. And would we want her moving into Russia? If she goes east and annoys her future only friend on the board, this might complicate their future relations.",True,True,-5
885,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Well, that‚Äôs a great idea. I am all for her moving on Russia if you can accomplish that. I‚Äôm certainly willing to go to Tyrolia.",True,True,5
886,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Alright. I'll plant the seed about anti-russia stuff. If she thinks you're a friend, though, she may listen to you more than me.",True,True,-5
887,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"FYI, she just asked me if I am talking with you. I told her: ‚ÄúI am wary of England right now. He just asked me what I want to do this turn. I feel like he‚Äôs trying to get me to leave MAO open.‚Äù",True,True,5
888,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,Cool. consistent with my messaging. I'm talking about a plan to leave Bre open and get her support to Gas so I can support into Spa. I'm asking for her to promise Bre to France and then bounce in Bre instead.,True,True,-5
889,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Then I'd dislodge in MAO and you'd retreat to IRI. We'll see what she thinks. I imagine she's just playing along, But I need to make specific plans to be believable",True,True,-5

891,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,Looks like germany is staying friendly with russia. Can we go over moves one more time so i can be sure we‚Äôre on the same page?,True,True,-5
892,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Here is what I have down right now:
MAO S Brest
WES S MAO
LYO - TYR S
Spa - Gas
Pie - Mar
Ven - Tyr
Nap - ION",True,False,5
893,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Cool. All expected. Right now I'm:
NAO to NWG
NTH hold
Wal to Pic
Channel convoy wal to pic
Bre support Wal to Pic",True,True,-5
894,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"I like it. 

As I think about it more, you may be better off moving North to Holland, expecting a bounce there. I think you‚Äôre slightly better off keeping the German fleet in Kiel, as it‚Äôs one less German unit in North Sea, but it‚Äôs not a huge difference either way.",True,False,5
895,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,That's good advice. I'll take it,True,True,-5
896,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,I‚Äôm kind of excited about this turn.,True,True,5
897,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,A stab is always exciting,True,True,-5
898,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"I‚Äôm sorry mate. You‚Äôve been a terrific ally. First class all the way. But on this turn, Germany made the kind of offer I could not refuse, and so I went for it.",True,False,5
899,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"I know that doesn‚Äôt make it any easier, but I really mean it when I say that you‚Äôve played a strong game, and been an excellent ally.",True,True,5
900,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"No worries, nicely played on your end. I think I can top Germany‚Äôs offer if you‚Äôre interested. Let me know!",False,True,-5
901,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,Hmmmm...I‚Äôm intrigued. Aren‚Äôt you supposed to be screaming obscenities at me right now?This response is downright classy and sportsmanlike.,True,True,5
902,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Haha yeah I suppose. But this game for me is about learning. I‚Äôm relatively new to the game, and I volunteered for the study 1) to help out my friend, and 2) to prep for an in-person game I have on August 11. So if I get the right experience from this game and do well in the in-person game (i.e. win bragging rights among my friends), I‚Äôve won MY game. Here is my offer: You bring me along to second place, I vow to help you solo as Italy, and you teach me how you pulled it off. What do you say?",True,True,-5
903,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,Well that is a better offer than Germany‚Äôs. One of the best offers I‚Äôve ever received. And I really mean it when I say that you‚Äôre a joy to play with and a strong ally. I‚Äôd be happy to teach you as much as I can.,True,True,5
904,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,I suggest you retreat to Skagerrak to put maximum pressure on Germany.,True,True,5
905,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Well i‚Äôm happy to learn if you‚Äôre willing to teach. Do we have a deal then? This is obviously something you‚Äôll have to trust me with. But I haven‚Äôt lied tp you yet and don‚Äôt intend to. And i imagine you can tactically keep me in a position where i‚Äôm not a threat. Also, on the teaching side of things I may have some questions about earlier in the game to learn how you set things up (and I would expect genuine answers!)",True,True,-5
906,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"And yeah, that retreat makes sense. You think norway and the home island are too defensive?",True,True,-5
907,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,I‚Äôll answer anything you ask honestly.,True,True,5
908,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"You have more options from Skag, and she can‚Äôt cover them all. You have a much higher upside from there, and it might be worth it for you to take Sweden to avoid having to disband.",True,True,5
909,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Regarding your offer: it may be hard to put you in second place, frankly. If your units are doing things that help me, then I‚Äôll try to keep your units on the board, and I definitely won‚Äôt allow you to be eliminated, but it‚Äôs really hard for me to ensure that you place second.",True,True,5
910,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,I can settle for survival. Deal.,True,False,-5
911,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Your reasoning on Skag makes sense. Going to bed now. First question on strategy is: how frequently dp you tell lies, and what are the typical circumstances?",True,True,-5
912,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Hmmm, well, you know, we‚Äôll have statistics to help answer that question at the end of the game. I‚Äôd say that I am mostly honest, and I place a lot of value on my credibility. I‚Äôm not going to lie about my moves to someone unless I am going to get a huge advantage out of it. But I spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that I‚Äôm their closest ally, so a lot of what I say is a shade on the truth.",True,True,5
913,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"So, I found it hard to decide whether to use a thumbs up or thumbs down quite a lot. Most of the time, there is some truth in what I‚Äôm saying, but I am trying to persuade the other player to do something for reasons I am not telling them.",True,True,5
914,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"So, in general, I‚Äôm not afraid to lie, but I am very afraid of getting caught lying. I try to preserve my credibility as best I can, but if I am setting up a stab, I will tell some serious whoppers.",True,True,5
915,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"Also, that thing France said about my past successes: that was true. I do have a lot of experience and I have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy. I just did not want you thinking of me that way.",True,True,5
916,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"I‚Äôll also note, just cause I have nobody else to talk with about this: I worked REALLY hard on this last move. Germany wanted to take Brest, but if that happened, it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island. So I had to convince Germany to support France to Brest, without telling her the real reason why. And I needed you to go to NAO so that you could not guard Liverpool. There were so many lies!ü§ûüò±",True,True,5
917,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,And that doesn‚Äôt even include the East!,True,True,5
918,1,1907,Spring,italy,england,"To be completely honest, I directed just about everyone else‚Äôs moves on that turn! Russia is the one exception, but I basically knew what he was going to do. The best advice I have for someone who wants to get better at Diplomacy: just work hard. You can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else. I have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time.",True,True,5
919,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"Yeah that‚Äôs one thing about online diplomacy I have mixed feelings about. It seems like there‚Äôs definitely a benefit from putting a lot of time in. I feel like I‚Äôve been putting a lot of time in as it is, but there‚Äôs been the temptation to put in more. For in-person everybody gets the same amount of time to chat, which can be an equalizer in some ways.",True,True,-5
920,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,"I had considered what a stab from you might look like before it happened, and I was like ‚Äúis he really going to all that trouble‚Äù but I suppose you were. Care to share why you chose Germany and how early you made that choice? What was the ‚Äúoffer‚Äù?",True,True,-5
921,1,1907,Spring,england,italy,And that‚Äôs cool that i‚Äôm playing with a champ!,True,True,-5
922,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"Hi England ‚Äî so I see that you retreated to Norway. Not what I expected, but it can work. Would you still like to work with me?",True,True,5
923,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"Yeah i know we didn‚Äôt chat about this. It was a little last minute, and you hadn‚Äôt responded in the morning so I didn‚Äôt think you were around (also I thought Ska was more a suggestion). I should have given you a heads up. My thinking was 1) it‚Äôs going to Sweden anyways, 2) i thought it might help warm relations with germany. Was this a bad call?",False,True,-5
924,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,I would still like to work with you,True,False,-5
925,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,Not a big deal at all.,True,True,5
926,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"I suggest that you take Sweden, and I‚Äôm working on getting Belgium this turn too. It‚Äôll be tricky to keep Germany from defending it, but I‚Äôm going to try.",True,True,5
927,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,Pic to Bel?,True,True,-5
928,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,And you were a bit shy about the earlier learning question. I guess it may be something sensitive to give an honest answer to at this time. One other question I have is whether there's a mistake you've seen in my play that you think I could have done differently. Like choosing to cold-shoulder France or choosing not to sneak into Sweden earlier.,True,True,-5
929,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"Also, France is asking about our relations after the stab. What would you like me to say?",True,True,-5
930,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,Something about how awful I am and how much you want revenge?ü§≠,True,True,5
931,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,Haha alright. I‚Äôll keep you ‚ÄúaBrest‚Äù of how France will move that fleet (should he choose to share),NOANNOTATION,False,-5
932,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"Okay, I think we have a good move brewing!",True,True,5
933,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"If you‚Äôre sincerely on board, this will be fun!",True,True,5
934,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"France is ordering Brest to Channel. 
Germany is ordering Burg S Bel and convoying Holland to Yorkshire....!",True,True,5
935,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"So here is the move:
Norway - Swe
Pic S Channel - Belgium
Mar - Bur to cut support
Gas to Bre to block the Paris move. 

I think you‚Äôre going to get a build this turn even if I take Liverpool. 

Does that make sense?",True,False,5
936,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"Yeah I'm on board, though I will remind you that you're forgetting an important part of the bargain. So I guess NWG to Edi (which is probably safe in case she goes for the build instead) and then plan to build in London?",True,True,-5
937,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,What part of the bargain am I forgetting? It‚Äôs unintentional. I‚Äôm trying to be helpful!,True,True,5
938,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,You overlooked a couple of my questions.,True,True,-5
939,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"I'm sure you've been busy setting up that move, so it's no big deal, just wanted to remind you",True,True,-5
940,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,Sorry.,True,True,5
941,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,You asked a question about what Germany offered me. Do you mind if I answer that after this move? I‚Äôd just like to see for sure that you‚Äôre sincere in working with me after I so rudely stabbed you.,True,True,5
942,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,Yeah that one's fair to skip for now I think.,True,True,-5
943,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"Germany is now fishing for info from me about our relationship. Does she know that we are still talking? I‚Äôd like to tell her that you‚Äôre mad at me and you will tell me nothing, but we must keep our stories straight.",True,True,5
944,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"No, but I'd bet she'd assume it. We didn't have much to say to each other this morning. I tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasn't going to work out. And I sent a message back but haven't heard anything.

957,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,I don‚Äôt think it matters. I believe he is lying to you.,True,True,5
958,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,Okay. Cause you had said he‚Äôd be going to the channel before. Is that still true? And any update on belgium?,True,True,-5
959,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,Working on it. I‚Äôll have an update in an hour.,True,True,5
960,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"Ok. I‚Äôll be asleep probably, but i‚Äôll see in the morning.",True,True,-5
961,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"So, it sounds to me like Germany thinks you are coming for her and she will not leave Belgium unguarded. 

I think your best bet will be the following:
Picardy - Brest (expect a bounce)
Channel - London (expect that The French fleet will move to the Channel, which will mean you don‚Äôt lose Brest, 
Norwegian to Edi (just in case)
Norway to Sweden

I was hoping for a better move involving taking Belgium, but I just don‚Äôt think I can swing it. 

Thoughts? What are you hearing now from France and Germany?",NOANNOTATION,True,5

965,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,Seems like she‚Äôs going to try to take Brest for herself.,True,True,5
966,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"I think you tell her ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but then order Pic to Bre and Channel to London. That way France moves out of Brest, and you bounce Germany in Brest and keep it.",True,True,5
967,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,And I‚Äôd stick with NWG to Edi and Norway to Sweden.,True,True,5
968,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,And by the way: Thank you very much for filling me in. Makes me feel really confident that you‚Äôre with me.,True,True,5

970,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"Ok,first question: You're saying she's going for Bre on her own, but she's suggesting Pic to Bre. Maybe she's hoping for you to support Paris in?",True,True,-5

972,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"Well, do you think she's being honest with me?",True,True,-5
973,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"It‚Äôs really hard for me to say. I know she is eager for her own builds, so my best guess is that she‚Äôs being partially honest with you and that she is going to grab London or Edi if she feels confident you are not going to cover.",True,True,5
974,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"Yeah, the suggestion of going to Cly is consistent with that. And that the channel moves away from london",True,True,-5
975,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"I think your suggestion makes sense. Covering Edi and London is safe, and Germany seems a bit unpredictable. And I keep fingers crossed that France indeed will vacate Brest",True,True,-5

977,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"I am planning to move to Liverpool. I‚Äôm sorry that costs you a unit. But the way this is going, it may very well be the last center I take from you, and I think it‚Äôs much more likely now that you take second place.",True,True,5
978,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"Ok gotcha. Hmm I just realized that I really have to hope for a bounce in Edi or London. Because If I get Bre and Swe, I would get a build even with you in Lvp, but then I wouldn't have an open home supply center to build at",True,True,-5
979,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"Well, you‚Äôre right about that. Perhaps ask Germany to bounce with you in Edi?",True,True,5
980,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"Though, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be getting a build now because you‚Äôre unlikely to get Belgium.

981,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"If I get Bre and Swe, but you get Lvp, I'm still net up by one (it will be rebuilding the disbanded fleet that was in Bre).",True,True,-5
982,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,Brest is already English.,True,True,5
983,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,Yeah. But I get the unit back is all I mean. I'm down to 4 now.,True,True,-5

987,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,This is getting tricky.,True,True,5

989,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,It‚Äôs possible. But I just don‚Äôt know.,True,True,5
990,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,I‚Äôd be really surprised if she wanted to cut out France at this point.,True,True,5
991,1,1907,Fall,england,italy,"Yeah, I think I have to play defensive then. I actually think aggression from her is more likely. I would be surprised if neither london or edi bounce. I'll say I agree to her proposal though.",True,True,-5
992,1,1907,Fall,italy,england,"Okay, I think that‚Äôs the right move. This is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view. It would be really great if you wind up with a build.",True,True,5

Well, I generally don‚Äôt like to play as Italy at all, frankly. But when I do, I go east. Not sure whether I‚Äôll head towards Turkey or Austria, but I think the one big advantage that you and I both have is that we have a mutual border that is easy to keep clear.

I‚Äôd like to keep our border clear and I‚Äôd like to act as ‚Äútrio wires‚Äù for each other.

I'd love to be trio wires. I've heard from everyone in the east, but not much substance, which probably means a bunch of passive openings.

That's the thing though- you don't want to be there. You want ME to be there so that you can keep pretending to be on England's side. And you want your units to be in France.

I don't doubt you were sincere. But launching an ineffective attack on England while Italy eats me from behind in the hopes that eventually Italy soloes even though he's going to get stopped at the stalemate lines because Italy just has to be friends with England? Not a fan. If there's a way forward it's with you sending a fleet to MAO and putting your fleets past the lines.

1299,1,1901,Fall,germany,england,"I'd be amenable to that. To be clear, Would you want me to move my fleet to Belgium while your North Sea fleet supports?",NOANNOTATION,True,0
1300,1,1901,Fall,england,germany,"So I could do this, but to secure the move you would also have to cut the support from Bur that France will likely give to move Pic to Bel.

1305,1,1901,Fall,england,germany,The reason is because I'd need your support into denmark to be sure russia couldn't bump me out. And it's putting a lot of trust in you to expect you'll just clear the way for me.,True,True,0
1306,1,1901,Fall,germany,england,"Well so what do you think of my counter offer, then?",True,True,0
1307,1,1901,Fall,england,germany,"I certainly appreciate it. The only issue is that it still doesn't guarantee Belgium for me. France may support Bur from Pic instead, and then it would be a bounce.",True,True,0
1308,1,1901,Fall,germany,england,"I have it on, admittedly, Italian authority that France is trying to make a play for Munich from Burgundy.

1316,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,You‚Äôre giving me too much credit. I forgot to click submit on my order for the north sea or something. Was surprised myself to see a hold there. So why did you back out of the deal then?,True,True,-1
1317,1,1901,Winter,germany,england,Preferred to see France there.,True,True,1
1318,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,"I can understand why you might have made that move, but I think it‚Äôs actually bad for both of us. Even if you and France team up to knock me out, france will get the better part of that deal and will then work with Russia to take you down.",True,True,-1
1319,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,"If I work with France, we‚Äôll bring Russia in on it (who needs some help after what happened with Turkey). This looks good for all three of us, and very bad for you.",True,True,-1
1320,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,"The last option is for us to work together against France. On the one hand, this is a good move because France is a strong player in a strong position. On the other hand, how am I supposed to trust you at all to cooperate?",True,True,-1
1321,1,1901,Winter,germany,england,"Real talk: I was given bad information that you and France were working together last round, which does not seem to be the case, but that's why I didn't follow through on our deal. I am well positioned now to take Belgium, and I can see now that, as you say, it would be much easier on me to ally with you rather than try to take you down even with France's help. But I can understand if you don't want to trust me.",True,True,1
1322,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,"I was working with France, and I still have a positive relationship with france. We agreed to stay out of the english channel, and france had agreed to support me into belgium. But this was about hedging my bets, not working against you. And you see how that played out haha.",True,True,-1
1323,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,France would love for me to be an ally in taking you out of the game over the next couple of years. They‚Äôve been talking about convincing russia to help with the takedown.,True,True,-1
1324,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,"A joint stab against france would require a high level of collaboration on our end. Something like an agreement to essentially act as one country up until a certain year. Sharing all planned moves, following up on them etc. So this would be my condition for working together.",True,True,-1
1325,1,1901,Winter,germany,england,"I would be willing to do that, but as I see it, you have no reason to choose France as an ally over me at this point. So, why me?",True,True,1
1326,1,1901,Winter,germany,england,*choose me as an ally over france,True,True,1
1327,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,"So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.",True,True,-1
1328,1,1901,Winter,germany,england,So basically France is too smart to be left alive and the world ought to belong to us idiots üòÇ,True,True,1
1329,1,1901,Winter,germany,england,What about Russia?,True,True,1
1330,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,"Haha yeah that was kind of my thinking. Russia is a little tied up in the south, and so I don't expect aggression in the north. However, france would respond to a stab by begging for Russian (and potentially austrian and italian) assistance. So the choice next year is between containing russia or being aggressive (which would mean going for sweden or St. P). I think the builds we see this winter will make it more clear what's possible.",True,True,-1
1331,1,1901,Winter,england,germany,"Speaking of, what are your planned builds? I'm building a fleet in London.",True,True,-1
1332,1,1901,Winter,germany,england,Armies in Kiel and Munich,True,True,1
1333,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"What are your plans for your north sea and London fleets?

I'm trying to decide now how best to handle Belgium and that is going to depend on whether France is concerned with defending Brest or if instead they expect help from you in disrupting anything I try to do from Holland. 

...I can offer you support in moving into Sweden in exchange for supporting my Burgundy troops into Belgium? Is that worth more than whatever France might be offering you right now?",True,True,1
1334,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"Any thoughts on my offer?
I have another proposal if you‚Äôre interested",True,True,1
1335,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,England. You're killin me here.,True,True,1
1336,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,Hey sorry. Busy evening for me. Let me think a second and respond to all this..,True,True,-1
1337,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"Ok so for one thing France isn't exactly offering me anything, so there's no real comparison of your offer vs theirs.",True,True,-1
1338,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"My once concern about the full-on france stab would be that the job couldn't be done quickly enough. We could force Bel this year, but we unfortunately wouldn't be able to put France down a unit because Spa is a guarantee for France. This may even allow for a rebuild in Bre if the Belgian army gets dislodged.",True,True,-1
1339,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,That's where my new plan comes in!,True,True,1
1340,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,Ok what's the sitch,True,True,-1
1341,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"You move fleets to Eng, Ska, and Nth this turn. Italy moves to Pie. I move Hol-Bel, Kie-Ruh, Bur-Gas, Mun-Bur. Now, France might foresee me attempting to take Gas, but more likely they want to dislodge me from Bur. This puts them in a position where they will have to lose one of Paris, Belgium, Marseilles, or Brest, and will not be able to vacate the others for building season.",True,True,1
1342,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,France could stop by bumping Par and Mar in Gas right? And you're suggesting my moves a setup of going against russia?,True,True,-1
1343,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"Also, have you talked to Italy about this?",True,True,-1
1344,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"Damn--I didn't think of the bumping. (sorry, this is just my first game and I'm still learning). And yeah I thought you'd want to grab Sweden because why not? 

I haven't discussed the full plan, but they seemed amenable to moving to pie",True,True,1
1345,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,Okay how about this:,True,True,1
1346,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"Keep your fleets in NWG and NTH, but move to ENG. Have NTH support HOL-BEL. 
I'll attack BUR-PIC, move KIE-RUH, MUN-BUR. If France does a Gascon Bounce, They'll have to lose either Brest or Paris or Marseilles. If they try to dislodge me instead, I'll retreat to Gascony. 
You still get my support to march on Sweden in Fall if desired.",True,True,1
1347,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,Keep in mind that Munich is vulnerable. Italy and Austria may have a deal in the works for that. But this is the sort of plan that I had thought through originally.,True,True,-1
1348,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,This would be a break of my DMZ with France in the channel. Which is why the success of a stab like this is especially important.,True,True,-1
1349,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"well ya could have saved me some brain cells by sharing it in the first place! üòõ  
And Italy and Austria, unless they're lying, think of me as an ally. That said, my plan doesn't actually involve vacating Munich",True,True,1
1350,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"Oh fair, because you're not actually moving into Pic, you're just cutting the support. I had you moving from Bur to Bel. Dislodging the French army from Bel could result in a disband. And if we don't get an additional supply center could mean a rebuild in Brest, which would be bad for me (adding Spain is probably a given). Have you considered the potential support of Mar from Spa s.c. ?",True,True,-1
1351,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"Yeah if my calculations are correct the French home supply centers hold. First move is to bounce in Gas to keep you out, then move spain to s.c. and lose bel. Next move is to support hold in mar from spain s.c. and then bounce paris to brest to keep me out. Bre, Par, and Mar all hold in the fall.",True,True,-1
1352,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"OK, Marseilles might be a no-go this round then. 

If you don't want a rebuild in Brest, we'll simply attack Picardy and force a retreat to Brest by an army. Not so bad for your fleet, right? I'll move into Paris from BUR",True,True,1
1353,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"wait I mean A retreat to burgundy by that army. Then the Parisian Army will be in brest, so no rebuild will occur",True,True,1
1354,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"Well, it kind of becomes rock paper scissors there. If I try to go into Brest it's a bounce and it remains open. If I don't, and France takes the risk of not going (probably won't happen) then it would stay open too.",True,True,-1
1355,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"Sounds like you'd like the belgian army to disband though. I understand, as it could help somebody out to take munich from Ruh.",True,True,-1
1356,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"whoa dude I just want a supply center don't go talking about people invading the fatherland

So are you saying no deal, then?",True,True,1
1357,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"No, I'm just echoing your probable reasoning for wanting the disband of the belgian army rather than its retreat to Ruh.",True,True,-1
1358,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"I don't see what that has to do with you, though? Like what difference does it make to you whether that army disbands or retreats to Ruh?",True,True,1
1359,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"The disband allows for a rebuild, if there's an open home supply center and France still has 5 total. So this could mean building a fleet in Brest.",True,True,-1
1360,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,ohhh I see. So what you're saying is you'd accept the deal if I didn't arrange for the disband and allowed a retreat to Ruh?,True,True,1
1361,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,"Let me sleep on it. I may be fine regardless. I'll confirm moves in the morning. But for this plan, Spring looks like your support into Sweden and my support into Belgium. I'll be very curious to see moves from Russia-Italy-Austria. If they all converge in on you, this could be trouble. I doubt that level of collaboration is going to happen though.",True,True,-1
1362,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,hang on would you be willing to postpone your sweden march until Fall? I'm not so keen on forcing Russia into the baltic,True,True,1
1363,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,You'd still hold sweden by winter,True,True,1
1364,1,1902,Spring,england,germany,Yeah that would be fair. Just need to run it by russia that norway is a hold in the spring so that doesn‚Äôt raise any eyebrows,True,True,-1
1365,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,"Well, or you could march into Finland just to spice things up",True,True,1
1366,1,1902,Spring,germany,england,Well England you've taught me an important lesson,True,True,1
1367,1,1902,Fall,england,germany,"This isn‚Äôt a full stab. I‚Äôm sorry for the deception though. I hadn‚Äôt heard whether Italy was anti-French. Now I have. I‚Äôm taking Denmark this year with Russian support. I‚Äôm sorry for that too. Kiel can‚Äôt save it. I‚Äôd suggest you bounce kiel and munich in Ruh and then attack holland from belgium to cut support . This will hold the line (unless france decides to let you into belgium, which would be unlikely).",True,True,-1
1368,1,1902,Fall,england,germany,"I know you don‚Äôt want to take advice from me, but you‚Äôre kind of in survival mode now. We can talk about belgium for you next year to get you back on your feet.",True,True,-1
1369,1,1902,Fall,germany,england,"England, I have 0.0 reason to trust your advice regarding France. You're so clearly working with them!",True,True,1
1370,1,1902,Fall,england,germany,"I think the tactical suggestion stands on its own though. You can work through the rules to verify it makes sense (and should, in case i‚Äôm making a mistake). Also I don‚Äôt know france‚Äôs moves this season. And you should ping italy to talk about me.",True,True,-1
1371,1,1902,Winter,england,germany,Nice! I guess you knew what you were doing.,True,True,1
1372,1,1902,Winter,germany,england,well not really--I just assumed that attacking a convoying fleet would disrupt the convoy and that was apparently wrong,True,True,-1
1373,1,1902,Winter,england,germany,Yeah you have to dislodge. But you held ruhr! And my way wouldn‚Äôt have worked actually. That‚Äôs a stalemate line if you do the same moves except the fleet goes to belgium (i think). Can only be broken if i support it. Of course france could choose to let you in to ruhr as well,True,True,1
1374,1,1903,Spring,england,germany,"Hi, not sure what you heard from italy. Looking forward to the three of us working against france though. Let me know where you‚Äôre at with this. I‚Äôd help you into belgium this year.",True,True,1
1375,1,1903,Spring,germany,england,"Okay, I‚Äôm down to cooperate.",True,True,-1
1376,1,1903,Spring,england,germany,"Ok. All i need from you in the spring is to not attack Nth. Then i‚Äôll support myself into the channel. Then i support you into belgium in the fall. And i don‚Äôt touch holland, kiel, or berlin. And russia doesn‚Äôt either. Maybe we get italy to move to Pie?",NOANNOTATION,True,1
1377,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,Hi. I‚Äôm guessing the move to HEL was to cut support. Should have let you know I was moving out. Are you still interested in collaboration for survival? We‚Äôre both a bit threatened right now.,True,True,1
1378,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,"Hi‚Äîyeah, because of bot troubles I never got reassured last turn that you wouldn‚Äôt support, say, France into belgium or something. So now here we are! France asked me to bump Nth to cut your channel support, just fyi",True,True,-1
1379,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,"To be clear I don‚Äôt intend to do that since I basically need everyone to fall back to keep my holdings this turn.
Do you have any clue what russia‚Äôs plans are?",True,True,-1
1380,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,"Not sure what russia will do, but I‚Äôd be a little concerned about berlin being surrounded. I won‚Äôt be attacking Kiel so your support will go through from there.",True,True,1
1381,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,"Does France think you‚Äôll be cutting support? Also, Italy has been sending some anti-french things my way. A three-on-one alliance could be good for all of us. Containing Russia may distract both of us if he gets aggressive.",True,True,1
1382,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,I told France (truthfully) that I couldn't cut your support this turn,True,True,-1
1383,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,Cool. Do you need me to cut support in BAL or do you have that covered with Munich support?,True,True,1
1384,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,"Also, Italy is on board with a stab against France.",True,True,1
1385,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,"Italy told me that, too. And actually, if I could count on you to cut BAL support, it would free up Kiel to try and defend Ruhr from france for a turn. However, if you're using that denmark fleet for something else just let me know",True,True,-1
1386,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,So I have kind of a crazy idea. I'm curious what you'd think of this.,True,True,1
1387,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,What if I let you into Denmark and I go for Sweden?,True,True,1
1388,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,"Well, if France goes for Holland I'd be in a slightly strategically worse position.",True,True,-1
1389,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,I was thinking you'd go from Kiel and bounce Holland with the HEL fleet. Then you get your build in Kiel,True,True,1
1390,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,"that wouldn't work because I need kiel to support berlin, i think?",True,True,-1
1391,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,Is Munich occupied doing something else? Italy told me he has no plans of cutting support there.,True,True,1
1392,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,Oh I guess Bur can do that though...,True,True,1
1393,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,that was my fear...,True,True,-1
1394,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,"Hmm... Yeah it may be safe to not do that then. Maybe next year. I may go for Sweden regardless. But if russia sees it coming and goes in, that could be a bit annoying",True,True,1
1395,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,"But without action, Russia probably takes Ank this fall and builds in Stp.",True,True,1
1396,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,Is it worth losing the channel this turn? because you could take sweden for sure if you were willing to use nth to convoy,True,True,-1
1397,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,Nth can't convoy to Sweden. SKA is in the way.,True,True,1
1398,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,doesn't need to. just convoy to norway and move your fleet from norway to sweden. then attack the baltic fleet from denmark. that way you don't lose norway,True,True,-1
1399,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,BAL could move to sweden to bounce. only way to guarantee would be to support from Denmark,True,True,1
1400,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,"ah crap you're right. sorry, wish I could help but all I have are land troops",True,True,-1
1401,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,"No worries. I'll give it a shot regardless. And if I do get the extra build, I can provide some serious support to your moves west",True,True,1
1402,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,Things are getting a little rowdy haha. The good news is that we both outlasted Turkey!,True,True,1
1403,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,RIP.,True,True,-1
1404,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,go team!,True,True,1
1405,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,you held the channel! but no sweden yet...,True,True,-1
1406,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,Yeah. I think the bounce there will be a start of negotiations with Russia. Clearly we were both on the same page.,True,True,1
1407,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,And you got holland back!,True,True,1
1408,1,1903,Fall,germany,england,ach but now there's French in ruhr that'll be a pain,True,True,-1
1409,1,1903,Fall,england,germany,"A bit. France starts to crumble when I don't have to support my fleet anymore, which is when Italy forces France to go south with its MAO fleet. Then I can start supporting your moves and we can get you into belgium, etc.",True,True,1
1410,1,1904,Spring,germany,england,"Are you gonna try for sweden again this season? France told me that they're not moving their Mid-Atlantic fleet and instead would prefer to oust you from the channel. 

Italy gave me the idea of supporting your Welsh troops to convoy into Belgium. But if I did would you mind giving it to me in the Fall? I could be way more useful to you if I could build another unit this winter",True,True,-1
1411,1,1904,Spring,germany,england,"(I told france I'd interrupt your support from Nth in exchange for France letting me take belgium next round, but at this point I almost don't think of Belgium as being theirs to give, hence I'd rather work with you)",True,True,-1
1412,1,1904,Spring,england,germany,"Russia and I plan to repeat the Sweden bounce. If that's to be trusted, this frees up Kiel and Munich.",True,True,1
1413,1,1904,Spring,england,germany,"I'm happy to give you belgium. My idea of the split is you get Bel and Par, I get Bre and Por, and Italy gets Mar and Spa. Obviously this won't all happen this year. But you in Bel makes sense long-term",True,True,1
1414,1,1904,Spring,england,germany,"The convoy makes me a bit nervous because if France goes to IRI, they'll get a home supply center in the fall.",True,True,1
1415,1,1904,Spring,germany,england,"Okay, no convoy then. 

How do you feel about reneging with Russia? If you moved into the baltic instead of bouncing and I moved into Denmark (this is also insurance in case I can't end up with Belgium this year), I could support you into sweden in the fall?",True,True,-1
1416,1,1904,Spring,england,germany,"I'd prefer to keep neutral with russia, as fighting a war on two fronts would be a lot for me. Belgium isn't guaranteed for you this year, but I think it's likely. France will have to respect the pressure in the south from Italy. This frees me up to cut support in Pic and support you in from Nth. Then you just have to cut support in Ruh and Bur (if there's still something there in the fall).",True,True,1
1417,1,1904,Spring,germany,england,"If France is honest with me, Ruhr will be free and Bur will be occupied. 

Let's be real here, though: Russia has at most two units to spare to threaten you, and likely not even that given the imminent pressure from Austria. I'm trying to work it out in the sandbox now but I really don't think they'd be an issue for you...",True,True,-1
1418,1,1904,Spring,england,germany,"Russia can support into Norway once he's in Sweden, and NTH won't be free to stop that.",True,True,1
1419,1,1904,Spring,germany,england,"Okay that checks out. Thanks for your patience!

...I was thinking of asking russia to support me into denmark this turn and offer to support them into sweden next season. I'm doing this a) to confirm for you that they're on board with the bump as you say, and b) to show that I'd like to work to build trust with them. However, if Russia already knows you and I are working together this will establish the opposite of trust. So I guess I'm asking if you think this is a good/useful idea, and also asking what russia knows about our plans?",True,True,-1
1420,1,1904,Spring,england,germany,Russia can only suspect that we're working together at this point. I haven't given any indication of collaboration. I'd say ask away.,True,True,1
1421,1,1904,Spring,england,germany,Are you definitely committed to not cutting support in Nth?,True,True,1
1422,1,1904,Spring,germany,england,"I really, really am. Maybe I'm just not creative enough, but because of my alliance with Italy, who is in turn strongly allied with Austria, I just don't see myself ever getting anywhere in this game unless I can expand westward into France. Hence, even though you're honestly scarier right now I'm inclined to be on your side for the foreseeable future. 
Now, you could just go copy-paste this message to France and I'd be royally screwed, so I hope that helps you believe you can trust me.",True,True,-1
1423,1,1904,Spring,england,germany,"Haha ok, glad to get the confirmation. On my end i‚Äôll confirm I am totally anti-french until France is out of the game. I‚Äôve actually ceased communications with France (maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear). I‚Äôd like all three of us to get our two builds each together. Then we can look east.",True,True,1
1424,1,1904,Spring,germany,england,"Russia's loyal to you even in the face of my temptation, btw.",True,True,-1
1425,1,1904,Fall,england,germany,We‚Äôre in a great spot. Belgium for you is a guarantee. Planning to take from holland or ruhr?,False,True,1
1426,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,Why do you ask? I assumed you were going to disrupt support from Picardy with a convoyed army while I disrupted Burgundy? That way you can still use Nth to support the channel in case France decides not to bother defending in the south,True,True,-1
1427,1,1904,Fall,england,germany,"I‚Äôm a little worried that a clever france may let me into Pic, knowing that belgium is gone, and then move into IRI for invasion. I‚Äôd almost rather cut Pic with the channel and risk losing the channel. And my favorite option is to support ruh to bel from nth, also risking the channel. The logic is that if I lose the channel, it won‚Äôt be for very long, but if I lose a home supply center, that will be very annoying. France seems pretty upset with me, so a kamikaze move to screw me over isn‚Äôt out of the question.",True,True,1
1428,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,"Yeah, I'm getting that vibe from France too. Let's go with moving me from Ruhr",True,True,-1
1429,1,1904,Fall,england,germany,"Sounds good. Consistent with that theory, we‚Äôd advise italy to support into Spain instead of Mar. It‚Äôs a tough call though",True,True,1
1430,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,"I mean, not really. The way Italy's positioned it seems like Spain is the only right call and that Marseilles will fall like a domino on a fault line next spring?

...unless we could confirm that France really doesn't intend to defend. Then Italy could potentially swipe both in one swoop. But even if France is saying such things to me (and they are) it's still a risk",True,True,-1
1431,1,1904,Fall,england,germany,"Marseilles isn't guaranteed to fall next spring. Suppose Italy supports into Spa. France can block that supporting MAO from Gas. Suppose in the spring, Italy changes course and goes for Mar. France can then support Bur to Mar from Gas. Unless I'm missing something, it's a guessing game until you're in Bur.",True,True,1
1432,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,"God dammit. Just when I think I get this game, I‚Äôm still not clear on how the ‚Äòcoast‚Äô thing works with fleets",True,True,-1
1433,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,Do you think I could trust Russia not to try to swipe Munich if I tried to take Bur this turn?,True,True,-1
1434,1,1904,Fall,england,germany,"Yeah the territory can only be occupied by one unit regardless of coast. But a fleet must go to either the north or south coast. MAO can go to both. The coast matters if say you want to go from Spain to Mar. You can go there from the south coast, but not the north coast. And if you wanted to do this, you could coordinate a bounce with the Ber and Tyr armies so Russia can't sneak in. You're planning to sneak into Mun unsupported?",True,True,1
1435,1,1904,Fall,england,germany,sneak into Bur*,True,True,1
1436,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,"well, at least to try for it. i hadnt thought of bumping with italy because i assumed tyr would move into pie",True,True,-1
1437,1,1904,Fall,england,germany,"Well your move only works if we let Bur into Mar, which means Italy doesn't try for Mar, which means pie would hold.",True,True,1
1438,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,"oh i thought italy was trying for spa? or rather, wherever italy decides to go there's a chance it might work, and then they'd want someone in pie",True,True,-1
1439,1,1904,Fall,england,germany,"We'll have to see which move Italy wants to make. If Italy goes for Spa, the choice is between a hold or an attack from Pie. I would say a hold makes most sense for Italy if you've decided you're going for Bur. This is because the alternative may be a bounce with Bur and Pie armies in Mar that would foil your plan to get to Bur and wouldn't give Italy anything.",True,True,1
1440,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,Okay that makes sense then.,True,True,-1
1441,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,As long as Italy doesn't want to try to convoy into Spain from Pie. Then Marseilles could be left open *and* tyrolia could potentially move into piedmont,True,True,-1
1442,1,1904,Fall,england,germany,"Yeah that could be an idea. Well, let me know when you hear from Italy. The good news is France will definitely be down one this year and maybe down two. And our progress will continue next year. At some point we should talk about post-war things.",True,True,1
1443,1,1904,Fall,germany,england,Does post-war things mean how we're going to deal with a seriously overpowered Austria/Italy?,True,True,-1
1444,1,1904,Winter,england,germany,"Yeah. Though the move into Trieste by Italy is interesting. I'm actually starting to worry about collaboration with France. Would Italy really be so greedy as to start a war on two fronts? Also, had you asked for a hold in Pie? (not that it would have changed the outcome)",True,True,0
1445,1,1904,Winter,germany,england,"I asked but Italy told me that they couldn‚Äôt guarantee they would or wouldn‚Äôt, and I can understand wanting to keep that info need-to-know. But what makes you think Italy and France would collaborate?? Also, I‚Äôm not so sure you should read that seizing of trieste as an act of war; Italy *did* help Austria take two supply centers this turn. Austria might have given it willingly",True,True,0

1447,1,1904,Winter,england,germany,"Austria expressed frustration to me about it. Also, Austria can't build. All of its home supply centers are occupied.

I will be moving Kie-Ruh for sure.
We can half-heartedly attack Pic this spring if you want (I'll move Bel-Pic, you support), though I doubt we'll get anywhere with it
Munich will support Kie-Ruh
And Fall I'll do a three-sided assault on Bur. 
None of this is very exciting though.  If Italy can't make headway we'll probably be stuck in a holding pattern until you can shift some resources from the baltic.",True,True,0
1451,1,1904,Winter,germany,england,"Actually, I got Italy on board to coordinate with us to leave one of Marseilles or Spain open for France to fall into.

1455,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,"Also, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on taking Russia's northern holdings.

But, realistically, as things stand now you, me, and Russia V. italy/austria just looks like me and russia getting sh*tkicked while you hang out in the back.

And speaking of fleet things: if you're not doing anything with Nth this turn anyway, could you help me out by supporting Hol-Bel?

I haven't heard back from France yet, but I am sort of playing double-agent with Italy to ensure that France can continue countering Italy's Spa/Mar plays and it just looks like luck. This keeps Italy in check until you and I make progress in the north and are better positioned to push Italy back.

I should have mentioned, but a third reason for the fleet build last turn was to keep France's trust. I figured it made sense anyway for the other two reasons I mentioned, but I did want to make sure France is willing to listen to me about Italy.",True,True,0

1485,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,"Today at 5:11 PM, italy said to me: ""If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)"". So, it could be that both are true and Italy plans to do *neither*--rather than try to take Spa, Italy's gonna try rearranging?",True,True,0
1486,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,*5:11 central time,True,True,0
1487,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,"Ok at 6:08 PM EST, italy asked about MAO. So that's around the same time. I'm not going to support MAO and told Italy as much.",True,True,0
1488,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,France would probably just cut in Bre anyways.,True,True,0
1489,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,Was that the reasoning you gave for not supporting?,True,True,0
1490,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,Just that it wouldn't be fruitful because France would cut support. I also said that I was eyeing it for next year (which will be obvious from my upcoming move of the Nwy fleet),True,True,0
1491,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,Alright well sounds like we resolved that little mystery. Statecraft is exhausting.,True,True,0
1492,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,Haha yeah. I don't know if I would do online diplomacy again (I've only done it in person). I've spent wayy too much time thinking about this game. But it's alson been fun,True,True,0
1493,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,I'm prepping for an august in-person game I have scheduled with some friends,True,True,0
1494,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,I have also been spending way too much time thinking about this! Yeah the days between adjudications are just too much.,True,True,0
1495,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,I agree. In person is exhausting for other reasons though. You have to take a whole day out and it‚Äôs much more stressful when you have 15 minute negotiations and everyone is in the same house.,True,True,0
1496,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,oh I didn't even think of the logistics of in person negotiating! So if you and Russia disappear for five minutes everybody knows somethings up?,True,True,0
1497,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,"Yeah, and also you see little cliques start to form. Like three countries will get together and then go quiet when someone else walks in the room. And you can just shout stuff to the room if you want. Also tactical and order errors are more common. And intentional order errors are a thing.",True,True,0
1498,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,That sounds like a perfect storm of social- and tactical-anxiety inducing stimuli. I think the ideal thing from my perspective would be online play with three adjudications per day. So it's about the same level of commitment as a really active group chat.,True,True,0
1499,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,Yeah people get pretty emotional. And I do it with a group of friends too. We decided we could only handle it once every 6 months or so.,True,True,0
1500,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,three times a day would be too much for me I think. I feel like I wouldn't get any work done.,True,True,0
1501,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,I could see that. But sacrifices have to be made.,True,True,0
1502,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,"Haha I'm NOT a multitasker, so I'd bet the sacrifice is bigger for me than it is for you. Also, I feel like it would be easier almost if I wasn't on the computer all day for work as it was. But having work and recreation competing for the same screen is really distracting for me.",True,True,0
1503,1,1905,Spring,germany,england,you just described me. and my situation. But I take summers as pseudo-vacation so there's not as much consequence,True,True,0
1504,1,1905,Spring,england,germany,"Yeah that's not a bad way to do it. I'm a grad student in the same school/department as admin actually. So I've also got a pseudo-vacation not taking classes or anything, but I'm still trying to be productive.",True,True,0
1505,1,1905,Fall,germany,england,"I'm in admin's department too! I should have realized: only grad students feel as guilty about spending time doing things they enjoy as you seem to üòõ 
But back to business: any chance of letting me borrow Denmark? I figure that with Northern Russia out of the picture your fleet's just sort of...parked there. But if you let me have it I will either build an army in Ber to help out Russia or an army in Kiel to fight France with. I totally understand if you don't want to, though.",True,True,0
1506,1,1905,Fall,germany,england,"Anyway, regardless of how you feel about the Denmark issue, I just hatched a plan to potentially help France keep resisting Italy, if you're game:

Tell Italy you've had a change of heart and want to support them into MAO this turn, on the condition that they free it up for you by moving to Portugal next spring. 
If italy agrees, let me know. I'll tell France to put all power into defending Marseilles and Mao. 

The hope is that since last turn *I* was the one who knew Italy's move and this time--as far as Italy knows--only *you'll* know it, Italy won't smell a rat when France is lucky in defending again",True,True,0
1507,1,1905,Fall,england,germany,No way! I wonder if we've been walking past each other in Iribe and without any idea that we're both in the study. And let's bring up Denmark again when I have another build secured. Who knows how long it will take to get into Brest.,True,True,0
1508,1,1905,Fall,england,germany,That's a reasonable plan for Italy. Let me get a sense of where Italy's head is at first. He may not even want MAO anymore.,True,True,0
1509,1,1905,Fall,england,germany,Can you explain the fleet move btw?,True,True,0
1510,1,1905,Fall,germany,england,"Honestly because I thought you‚Äôd say yes to giving me Denmark.
I doubt we‚Äôve run into each other because I‚Äôm in St Louis for the summer",True,True,0
1511,1,1905,Fall,england,germany,"Yeah, we should have talked about that  before probably. On its own, the move has a somewhat anti-me connotation. And yeah I definitely have not been to St Louis this summer haha",True,True,0
1512,1,1905,Fall,england,germany,You're going for Bur this season?,NOANNOTATION,True,0
1513,1,1905,Fall,germany,england,"Sorry to spook you! And not to beat a dead horse, but: you claim you want to secure another build, but with your denmark fleet basically stuck where it is, it‚Äôs not like keeping it is going to help you with that goal. That supply center‚Äôs doing nothing for you except maintaining the unit bound to it. *I* on the other hand, could help you get what you want by getting another build.

If you have plans to use the denmark fleet, I‚Äôll respect them, because right now our goals are the same. But I see no point in keeping the fleet just for its own sake.

Yep, going for Bur",True,True,0
1514,1,1905,Fall,england,germany,Yeah I mean it's a bargaining chip. Russia has to be in my good graces while I have it. And it's something I could offer you in exchange for something nice. It's not clear to me why you need it right now. Paris has your name on it. You'll win the eventual for Mar with no trouble.,True,True,0
1515,1,1905,Fall,germany,england,"Alright, that‚Äôs a valid reason.
I was feeling more urgent about it because I think it‚Äôs paramount that Russia get some aid against Austria.",True,True,0
1516,1,1905,Fall,england,germany,"Yeah that's fair. I think Russia is clever enough to re-instate the stalemate, though. Maybe I'll drop him a line to see what he's thinking.",True,True,0
1517,1,1905,Fall,england,germany,BTW italy plans to literally randomize his move choice.,True,True,0
1518,1,1905,Fall,germany,england,Thanks for letting me know!,True,True,0
1519,1,1905,Fall,england,germany,Nice job on Bur. Let's see if we can get you paris next year!,True,True,0
1520,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,What's your plan for taking MAO? If you want to move Eng-IRI I will support Nth into the Channel?,True,True,0
1521,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"Yeah i was thinking the same actually. Only risk is a bump in IRI i think results in dislodge of the current channel unit. I‚Äôm willing to risk it though. France at this point is likely trying to choose who to annoy the most as he goes down. I have a feeling it will be me, even though i‚Äôm not the one taking his territories so far. I‚Äôll probably go another year without a build unfortunately",True,True,0
1522,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"Patience, my tea-sipping friend üòõ 
But if you dislodge trying to get IRI that means you at least got Nao, and putting the unit in Pic would help you take Brest anyway",True,True,0
1523,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,Oh i‚Äôm planning nwg to nth so that i‚Äôm still in nth. Do you think the brest fleet may move to Pic?,True,True,0
1524,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"ya know, if you'd just let me have Denmark back you could keep Nth *and* get at least one of Nao/Iri/Brest this year.
I can keep talking to France to see where their head's at, but I think a move to Pic is probably not in the cards. If you were to predict it France'd lose Brest!",True,True,0
1525,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,Are you still on good terms with France? Was the move into Bur expected?,True,True,0
1526,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"It was, actually. France has seen the end coming for a while, but since I was willing to work with them against Italy while you two ghosted, they're more amenable to my invasion that yours or Italy's.",True,True,0
1527,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"Makes sense. Well, let me think about whether Denmark is a possibility (though I‚Äôm still very hesitant) and get back to you. And I let me know what France is up to with Brest.",True,True,0
1528,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"Alternatively, why not just leave Nth empty for a turn? 
I'm working on figuring out France as we speak...",True,True,0
1529,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"Cool. And I suppose I could, though it does leave me a little vulnerable. Maybe we could talk a bit about what our collaboration looks like over the next couple of years",True,True,0
1530,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"Well, I can say definitively at this point that France prefers to mess with Italy over you. Basically they don't want to see Italy totally dominate this game. I encouraged this by saying that Italy's going to try for MAO this turn and they should focus on defending that. 

Wrt the next couple years, my idea is this: it's crucial that you take Mao, and that I take Paris. From here, you and I can work on beating Italy out of the Iberian, such that you end up with Portugal, Marseilles, and Spain and I end up with Brest and Paris (though you can have Brest at first). From here we're well positioned to start hitting Italy on their home turf, esp. if Russia can keep hammering away at Austria",False,True,0
1531,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,...any thoughts on this?,True,True,0
1532,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,That all makes sense. Thought I'm a bit surprised that you'd rather have Brest than Mar. What's the reasoning for that preference? And how long would you let me hold onto Brest?,True,True,0
1533,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"I figured this split would give you land and sea options for attacking italy and not for attacking me. But I was just spitballing, and it may make more sense to divide it your way...And you could hold Brest until we were the only two in all of France and Spain, I suppose",True,True,0
1534,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,have you made a decision yet about what to do about Nth?,True,True,0
1535,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,I prefer to do the same moves as last time. So Nth would be a hold. I don't think MAO is going to IRI or NAO. But you would have the inside scoop.,True,True,0
1536,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,What would you do with Bel if it was freed up?,True,True,0
1537,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"Wait when you say Nth is a hold, do you mean you *don't* want to try for IRI like we talked about, and you're just holding the channel?",True,True,0
1538,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"That‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking now, yes",True,True,0
1539,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"*just holding the channel and convoying to Brest?

And if by ""it"" in ""what would you do with Bel if it was freed up?"", you mean Nth, then probably move it to Pic in case France tries to bounce me out of Paris. But it might make more sense for you to just convoy to Pic, in which case Bel could support you into Pic",True,True,0
1540,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"oh nevermind you mean ""what would you do with Bel if Bel wasn't supporting Nth""? Well, my answer still applies",True,True,0
1541,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,...Would you like me to support your army into Pic?,True,True,0
1542,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,That army isn‚Äôt leaving the island until france‚Äôs fate is sealed. Otherwise I open up my home centers to France.,True,True,0
1543,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"but you did convoy to brest last time? Was that just because you were sure the army would bounce? 

So then basically everyone's holding still except you're poking Nao?",True,True,0
1544,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"Yeah that‚Äôs my plan. The convoy was because if it worked, I could just build on the island and be fine. But i‚Äôm taking on a risk if i can‚Äôt guarantee the build.",True,True,0
1545,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"ohh gotcha. I'm moving Bur-Par, Ruh-Bur. Everyone else is just staying put",False,True,0
1546,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,I really am curious about your relationship with France btw. Italy mentioned that you asked him recently whether collaboration with France was ok. But what could that mean unless it was against me?,True,True,0
1547,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"üôÑ Italy said that you were plotting against me, too! They're just trying to make us suspicious of each other!",True,False,0
1548,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,So you‚Äôre saying italy lied to me? I‚Äôm gonna make you click that thumbs down if you‚Äôre trying to fool me here.,True,True,0
1549,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"Well, no. It's true that I asked Italy about collaborating with France, but only because France wanted us all to be able to talk about its last will and testament together. I didn't bother asking you because you had been pretty clear on ghosting France, but I wasn't sure whether Italy was or not til I asked",True,False,0
1550,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,But it's very possible that Italy took this fact and warped it to make you suspicious of me,True,True,0
1551,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"So, while we're at it, is there anything you might have said to Italy to indicate you were planning to turn on me?",True,True,0
1552,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,Well i‚Äôm glad i asked the follow up question. Did italy agree to being part of this discussion? And how did the discussion turn out. Is France going to take out his anger on me with a final stab? Are you going to help him? And yeah i‚Äôve absolutely been talking up anti-german things to italy. I want him to be confident in where i stand so he doesn‚Äôt expect a stab.,True,True,0
1553,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"Oh italy said ""I don't trust France"" and that was the end of it. So no, there didn't end up being a discussion except me telling France that you're gunning for Brest (which was obvious anyway), and that Italy's shooting for Mao this turn (which may or may not be true--but by this time you and I were strategizing and I wanted to keep France out of our way). 
If france *is* planning to stab you, they're intentionally throwing me off the scent. Which would be surprising but not unheard of. So no, I'm not planning to help in a stab I know nothing about.",True,False,0
1554,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"Well, to be clear, another consequence of my and France's conversation was that France is just letting me walk into Paris this turn (unless they're gonna stab me but I doubt it)",True,True,0
1555,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"Yeah i believe that. So i guess it‚Äôs just giving italy a hard time then, or maybe some unexpected movement north. Has italy talked to you about attacking me?",True,True,0
1556,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,Post-france?,True,True,0
1557,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,Well yeah. In the same convo where they said you were plotting to stab me they gave some reasons why it's better for me to side with them than with you. So no specifics but Italy clearly wants us against each other. But I don't think either of us stand a chance if we fall for that.,True,True,0
1558,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"*no specific attacks were suggested, I mean",True,True,0
1559,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"Gotcha. Well i think we have to acknowledge that our alliance would be sort of geographically awkward. I think that makes the alliance stronger actually, but we should be honest with each other about an exit that gives each of us a fair shot in the endgame.",True,True,0
1560,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"okay...well, as the person who has ever seen an endgame before, what do *you* suggest?",True,True,0
1561,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"I think we agree to coordinated actions until italy is dealt with. I think you in brest is actually more fair, although less ideal for me.

1562,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"Alright. But it will be harder to flip Austria against Italy, I think.",True,True,0
1563,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"Nah, i‚Äôve been working on it a bit, and it‚Äôs only natural once his current conflict is mitigated somewhat",True,True,0
1564,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,I think between us we should find a split of dots we feel comfortable with. Not that it can‚Äôt change in future negotiations. But i think it‚Äôs easier to stay friends when the end seems fair from the get-go,True,True,0
1565,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"We don‚Äôt have to do this tonight, but soon.",True,True,0

1569,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"I think so, too. And Italy is like the over-est of dogs.",True,True,0
1570,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,You lost me haha. The over-est of dogs?,True,True,0
1571,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"like, the opposite of underdog would be overdog. And Italy is the most over-est overdog there is.",True,True,0

1573,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,Haha gotcha. Do we think he‚Äôs actually the number 1 guy like france said? He denied it to me. But the username lines up.,True,True,0
1574,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"I think it's more probable than not. Although, I also think it's really unfair to have that information leaked when other players get the benefit of a clean slate. That said, just looking at the way Italy moves and talks it's clear that they know what they're doing",True,True,0
1575,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,Yeah he‚Äôs definitely a good player. All the better when we take him down.,True,True,0
1576,1,1906,Spring,germany,england,"ugh I really wish everyone'd stop using *he* all the time. France and Italy know each other from outside this game, but it irks me that ""he"" seems to be the default. Out of curiosity, do you/others use ""she"" when referring to me?",NOANNOTATION,True,0
1577,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,"I had been using ‚Äúthey‚Äù, but then i stopped once i saw other people using gendered pronouns. My rationalization was that the other players must have been confident in their correctness to start using them, but obviously that‚Äôs not true. We use ‚Äúshe‚Äù for you.

1579,1,1906,Spring,england,germany,Yeah that‚Äôs totally fair. I will admit I had floated the idea of trying to play feminine and flirt with one of the probably straight male players to gain favor. The username‚Äôs a giveaway though. And that might be taking things too far haha.,True,True,0

1585,1,1906,Fall,england,germany,"Well now you've seen me make exactly the moves that I said I would, so hopefully you have some trust in me.

1587,1,1906,Fall,england,germany,I'm definitely a bit upset about the support into the channel you gave and all of the lying. You didn't need to lie about your moves to amp up the aggression on denmark: I never asked for a full list of moves.,True,True,0

1594,1,1906,Fall,germany,england,"Doubly confirmed by France and Italy. They've reached an agreement to give Italy the channel.

1605,1,1906,Fall,england,germany,Did italy tell you MAO would take Portugal?,True,True,0
1606,1,1906,Fall,germany,england,No. I haven't given them my opinion on the channel deal yet. But that would be what I'd suggest they do instead,False,True,0

1610,1,1906,Fall,england,germany,He suggested some defensive tactics to me.,True,True,0
1611,1,1906,Fall,germany,england,Defensives against me? in Denmark? Or France in Iri? Or both?,True,True,0
1612,1,1906,Fall,england,germany,Both. He‚Äôs under the impression that we are not friendly after those last moves. I don‚Äôt plan to take his suggestion though,True,True,0
1613,1,1906,Fall,germany,england,"I'm wondering if these defenses involve you not supporting Eng, which would kind of half-confirm the plot.",True,True,0
1614,1,1906,Fall,england,germany,They do involve me not supporting Eng.,True,True,0

1617,1,1906,Fall,england,germany,"Umm the plan doesn't work btw. Gas is just going to cut the Par support that you promised me (this is the only useful thing it can do). So, no deal, unfortunately. I'll see if I can get last minute support in from Italy and let you know.",True,True,0
1618,1,1906,Fall,germany,england,"I really don't think an attack from Gascony would be an issue, but I understand that your trust in France is much lower than mine. We could still work together somehow, though?",False,True,0
1619,1,1906,Fall,england,germany,"In a tactical sense, anything else from Gascony would be a misfire. So not cutting the Paris support is just giving up Brest. I really don't think France is just going to hand Brest to me. I'm still waiting to see if I can get Italian support, in which case we're back in business.

1620,1,1906,Fall,england,germany,Ok. Hope you'll see this before noon. Italy has agreed to support into Bre. I also require Par support for this to go through. Do you agree to provide Par supports channel to Bre and Bel supports Nth to Channel? I will vacate Denmark if so,True,True,0

1646,1,1907,Spring,england,germany,Or say that you'll support France in?,True,True,-2
1647,1,1907,Spring,germany,england,hmmm that could work! Then we only have to trust that Italy won't try and take Brest. Which isn't too far fetched since they *just* helped you take it,True,True,2

1675,1,1907,Spring,england,germany,Ok just to be really specific about it: Can we agree on the story that we ceased communications.

1680,1,1907,Spring,england,germany,"I think Italy wanted to be the one to tell me so he would keep my trust. I‚Äôd have to look to see whether this was revealed before or after Brest went through, but I know at least that before Brest I was confident he wasn‚Äôt going for the channel.",True,True,-2
1681,1,1907,Spring,germany,england,"Well anyway, what did you want to tell me? It stays between us, guaranteed, but I would reserve the right to move according to this information if I think it necessary",True,True,2

There were so many lies!""",True,True,-2

But England's desperate. Better to talk with someone than just go in blind. And I doubt they'd turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there's precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France.

...and here's the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you've been sneaky and you've always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so easy to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. 

I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over.

1841,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"Hi England,
I know that the last thing I said to you was that a partnership between us wouldn't work out, but I've had a genuine change of heart. The reason for that is that I think Italy is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized; right now they may be promising you that you'll take centers of mine, and maybe even that you two will share a victory together. This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago. But we both need to face facts: Italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between us, and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger. 
If you're tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory. This proposal involves France, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Italy. Trusting them may be a hard sell, but so is trusting me. If I were really trying to trick you, I wouldn't ask something so unreasonable as that you trust us both. But frankly I consider knocking Italy down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing we can do to keep this game viable for any of us. 
My proposal is: NWG-Cly, Nth convoy Hol-Yor, Eng-IRI or Wal, Bel s Bre-Eng, Pic-Bre, Par-Pic, Bur-Par, Mun-Bur (I figure I'm about to lose Mun anyway, and if that happens I'll disband my Hel fleet)
Next year we'll be well-positioned to boot Italy off the island and the iberian. What do you think?",False,True,2
1842,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"(this part is not for copy-pasting to Italy) I designed this plan to make it look safe for Italy to convoy Gas-Lvp. I know this is what they'd really like to do. I think we need to do everything we can to try and disrupt this. I know it's a riskier move trying to assist Bre into Mao but I think it's the right one. I also think that for *extra* insurance NWG should poke NAO, because worst-case scenario Italy doesn't try the convoy and moves Nao-Lvp and also moves Mao-Nao to bounce. This guarantees Bre makes it into Mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings, and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking Italy out of Liverpool. In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build. That part of the fake plan is actually true",True,True,2
1843,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,Italy is telling me to expect a bounce in Bre. So that‚Äôs not consistent with the convoy idea. Maybe he‚Äôs lying?,True,True,-2
1844,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,But i haven‚Äôt sent the plan yet,True,True,-2

1846,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"Italy can't make a bounce if we attack Mao and Gas at the same time, which the real plan has us doing",True,True,2
1847,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"That‚Äôs fair, it could be a bounce we expect from you. Keep in mind that the French fleet disbands in the fall, assuming it leaves Bre. So if it gets into MAO, it will then vacate by spring",True,True,-2
1848,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"Better to vacate Mao than Gas, I think.",True,True,2
1849,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"Hmm, i mean if we really think it‚Äôs a convoy, disrupting the convoy is a great option. You‚Äôre saying i support Bre from channel? And let me see how Italy responds to the message",True,True,-2

I'm making a sacrifice too by convoying to york instead of Edi, and I'm willing to do that because I think it's the right move. Even if there's not a convoy, there's still a chance you fall into Nao which is advantageous.",True,True,2
1853,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,The way I see it we don't stand a chance unless we can take mao and start beating Italy back into the mediterranean,True,True,2

1858,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"It‚Äôs quite alright. Do you think it‚Äôs worth saying anything to germany? If you‚Äôre confident that the convoy is the move, what additional edge do we get by sharing fake info?",True,True,-2
1859,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"You mean to Italy? I do think it's worth it, because Italy will realize that I'll turn to you if I'm no longer allied with him. By reporting the plan, you cement Italy's trust in *you*. If you didn't report the plan, Italy'd suspect you. It also gives Italy a false sense of confidence in what I'll do.

Tentative request: after the stab goes through, do I have your permission to send Italy the quotes from Italy that you've sent me? Italy went to *such lengths* to defend himself and make *me* feel guilty for questioning him, and the sheer hypocrisy of it is so revolting. I want to throw his own betrayal back in his face. I figure he's not going to trust you after the stab anyway.",True,True,2
1860,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"furthermore, Italy may respond to my plan by offering *you* moves to counter it, and you can bet that the moves offered will turn to Italy's benefit. We can see if these moves keep you away from Mao and Nao, which will further confirm Italy's got his eyes on the convoy",True,True,2
1861,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,Ok i have to get to campus. Let me send the quote to italy and then i‚Äôll process all this and respond later.,True,True,-2
1862,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"Oh and one more thing: as long as we think the convoy is the real move, we also know that Spain is gonna support Mao, unless Italy is really really cocky. So I'll need to support you into Bre with Paris to make sure you get there. This means Burgundy will have to try for Gas unsupported, but again, if we're confident the convoy is the play i'm willing to risk it",True,True,2
1863,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"I've told France the new move is to Mao and France confirmed. So, the moves the plan needs from you are:

Pic-Bre (Paris will support)

Let me know if you take issue with any of these, or if you ever hear back from Italy. 
We have a shot that at least one of these moves will get us somewhere. But I recognize this plan is nowhere near as sure a thing as if you just cooperated with Italy. I want to give you one last chance to back out.",True,True,2
1864,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,Alright I'm online now. Give me a moment to process everything.,True,True,-2
1865,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"Ok, all of this looks good to me.",True,True,-2
1866,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"Great! Note that you actually gain a build with this plan. So even if the move to Nao doesn't pan out, you can just build an army in Edi and use that to take back lvp",True,True,2
1867,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"Yeah that's what I'm thinking. If we dislodge the convoy, I get two! You really think Italy won't try to snag Por?",True,True,-2

1869,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"If they're convoying, I would bet not. If they're not convoying, then perhaps, but I think an open Mao is still better than an Italian mao. 

Those moves look good! No word from Italy?",True,True,2
1870,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"From Italy: ""Okay, I think that‚Äôs the right move. This is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view. It would be really great if you wind up with a build.""",True,True,-2
1871,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,"wait, he thinks *what* is the right move?",True,True,2
1872,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"I said I'd agree to your proposal but instead move to London and Edi, expecting one of them to bounce.",True,True,-2
1873,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,Brilliant. Let's hope he buys it,True,True,2
1874,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"He definitely trusts me, which is why I think no support from Spa is a possibility. Like if he really trusts me going to london, why wouldn't he go for it?",True,True,-2
1875,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"Also, I'm really hoping you won't lose Mun. That would cause some problems.",True,True,-2
1876,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"Can you copy in your set of moves just so I can see the summary? If there's any you want to strike from the record out of paranoia, I totally understand.",True,True,-2

1878,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,Cool. I guess the support in Bel is only relevant if MAO surprises with supporting Bre in or something like that,True,True,-2
1879,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,right and I have a weird bias for having my units *do* something other than hold.,True,True,2
1880,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"I also wanted to talk post-war relations since you brought that up. My ideal would be total silence to Italy from both of us. As tempting as it is to gloat, Italy will use any gloating we do to convince others on the board that we're schemers, unreliable, sharing intel at an absurd level etc.",True,True,-2
1881,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,We also should start courting Austria once the moves go through,True,True,-2
1882,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,post-stab relations*,True,True,-2

1884,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"Yeah no sharing of specific moves with Austria, at least not at the beginning. But the alliance is natural since I'm moving against Russia and we're both moving against italy. And we really want it to be a solid 3 on 2.",True,True,-2
1885,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,Nicely done. Thoughts on the silence to italy idea?,True,True,-2
1886,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,"Also, austria just took a beating",NOANNOTATION,True,-2
1887,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,Accurate. We should sent condolences their way.,True,True,2
1888,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,And I won't speak to Italy,True,True,2
1889,1,1907,Fall,england,germany,Ok. I won't either. He's going to be sending some nasty-grams our way I'm sure.,True,True,-2
1890,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,yeah if you get a juicy one send it to me!,True,True,2
1891,1,1907,Fall,germany,england,ugh I'm kicking myself I wish i'd supported Bur-Gas. But hindsight's 20/20,True,True,2
1892,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,So maybe try to cool it with Russia...I'm thinking we're gonna need to go 4 on one if we want a shot at stopping him,True,True,1
1893,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,Yeah i‚Äôll try to be amicable with russia. I feel like you‚Äôll have more sway since you didn‚Äôt just take his territory,True,True,-1
1894,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,Italy just said ‚Äúwell played‚Äù,True,True,-1
1895,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,Well he's correct about that,True,True,1
1896,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,And I'm trying to make overtures to Russia and Austria right now,True,True,1
1897,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,Haha yeah. I agree that taking down Italy will be tough even if he‚Äôs operating mostly alone.,True,True,-1
1898,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,"Italy to me: ""Well, this game just got less fun""",True,True,1
1899,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,"Haha. Still figuring out what builds will be. Trying to piece together a plan to get you a build from Italy this year, but it looks like that may be a challenge. We'll have to make a couple of good guesses.",True,True,-1
1900,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,"I think your builds are pretty obvious, right? Fleet in Lvp, army in Edi? 
In spring, I'll support Edi into Lvp. Meanwhile Lvp moves IRI with support from the channel and Nwg pokes Nao.",True,True,1
1901,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,"With your permission, I'll move Nth-Edi and then Edi-Cly in the fall. This way we can shove Italy out of Nao come next spring.",True,True,1
1902,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,"I agree with the builds, and I'll review the tactics. We really need an italian disband this year to break the line. With what you've presented we won't get Spa or Mar, and by next spring we may have Italy in Lyo and Wes. Not sure if we have a better option on our end, but I'll keep thinking.",True,True,-1
1903,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,Right I don't think there's much we can do about the south besides get one of us in gascony and put a fleet in Brest and hope for the best.,True,True,1
1904,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,"Nevermind: it's better I think to risk Italy in Nwg, since that's actually not a huge threat. Nwg should go to Edi and Nth should go to Lon. Dammit, we'd be in such a better position if I hadn't been so paranoid that Russia would move to Munich! Then I'd have kept my fleet in Hel",True,True,1
1905,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,"Was just running through some tactics. I think I found an issue, but I want to check with you. Suppose Italy ends up with Fleet in Portugal, army in spain, fleet in lyo, fleet in wes, army mar. I think this is a stalemate line. And I don't think we can do anything to stop Italy from forming it.",True,True,-1
1906,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,I mean you could mess with North Africa from MAO I guess. But at that point we're looking at Tunis as the next build on our front. And that only works if neither NAO nor IRI gets behind the line.,True,True,-1
1907,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,Fingers crossed you can find a flaw in my thinking.,NOANNOTATION,True,-1
1908,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,"I guess the point is that no amount of cleverness is going to get us those dots until we see disbands (if my thinking is correct, of course)",True,True,-1
1909,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,"I think you‚Äôre right‚Äîif dots is what you‚Äôre after, you‚Äôre better off stabbing me and Russia than collaborating. But I think you‚Äôll that just getting italy under control takes priority. Russia and Austria might see some dots, but if we do it‚Äôll take a lot longer",True,True,1
1910,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,I agree i could stab russia with moves on st p or something. I‚Äôm not in great tactical position to stab you right now if i wanted to. No question that italy‚Äôs the target. But we‚Äôll be dancing with those fleets until they‚Äôre off the board from a loss of supply centers. That changes my thinking about our moves a bit.,True,True,-1
1911,1,1907,Winter,germany,england,I know for a fact we can disband at least one of the fleets. I ran quite a few sandboxes in lieu of working today and I'll share moves in the morning.,True,True,1
1912,1,1907,Winter,england,germany,"Yeah if you found one, that‚Äôs great. Let me know",True,True,-1
1913,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,"woah, all armies from italy. I guess I was seeing things through the lens of the worst he could do to us.",True,True,-1
1914,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,"Given that the beta test ends in 1909, what are your goals? Just duke it out until then?",True,True,-1
1915,1,1908,Spring,germany,england,"was not aware of that! But yeah, I'll just go down fighting Italy like hopefully everyone else.",True,True,1
1916,1,1908,Spring,germany,england,That's pretty disappointing this game was just getting good,True,True,1
1917,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,"Yeah admin said this in the general thread a while back. I agree it‚Äôs a bit of a shame to see it cut short. But i suppose we‚Äôre just the beta testers. I will be glad to be finished though. It was fun, but like WAY too much distraction and stress haha.",True,True,-1
1918,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,Would you play online again after all this?,True,True,-1
1919,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,I‚Äôm not sure I would.,True,True,-1
1920,1,1908,Spring,germany,england,"I think I would! you're right that it's way too much distraction but, hey, it keeps me off the streets",True,True,1
1921,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,Hmm something tells me that you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be out committing violent crimes haha. But then again how well do i really know you from playing a lying game. I will say I‚Äôd be down to do an in-person one with CS students at some point.,True,True,-1
1922,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,Btw all other powers (me included) will be setting for a 5-way draw this move.,True,True,-1
1923,1,1908,Spring,germany,england,"I had been thinking the same thing! Do you know anyone besides me and admin at UMD who plays?

Uh huh...sureee they will",True,True,1
1924,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,"AFAIK there's no drawback to submitting the draw order (if you're ok with the outcome). If there's not consensus, play just continues as normal. Well I think admin' adviser has played. I know [redacted] had expressed interest in playing. Not sure about students though.",True,True,-1
1925,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,And I'm sure I could recruit a couple of non-UMD friends to play.,True,True,-1
1926,1,1908,Spring,germany,england,"I'm on board with the five-way draw, by the way. 

And I think there's a couple board game enthusiasts in my lab who may not have played this particular game before but would probably like it...if you don't mind playing with new people",True,True,1
1927,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,Yeah always down to play with new folks. And I‚Äôm down for the draw as well,True,True,-1
1928,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,"Reply all to Italy's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the ""Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders"" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.",True,True,-1
1929,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,:‚Äô( we were supposed to hug it out!! Any idea who wasn‚Äôt on board?,True,True,-1
1930,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,Sorry for not coordinating moves. I really thought the game was gonna be over,True,True,-1
1931,1,1908,Spring,germany,england,So did I! And I have no clue who wasn't on board,True,True,1
1932,1,1908,Spring,england,germany,I guess we try the draw again?? I suppose it‚Äôs possible a game could be set up to not support the regular draw settings. I dunno.,True,True,-1
1933,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,"Not sure your interest level in the game at this point, but we should at least make sure italy doesn‚Äôt win right?",True,True,-1
1934,1,1908,Winter,germany,england,can italy take five centers this turn??,True,True,1
1935,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,"Nah, but maybe admin will be like ‚Äúoh btw let‚Äôs go until 1914 now!‚Äù.",True,True,-1
1936,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,Any guesses on who is holding out on the draw?,True,True,-1
1937,1,1908,Winter,germany,england,who keeps screwing with the draw though! Do you think Italy suggested it just to mess with all of us?,True,True,1
1938,1,1908,Winter,germany,england,oh haha we just asked the same thing,True,True,1
1939,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,"That‚Äôs my best guess. He‚Äôs kind of the only one with the incentive to keep it going. And with his winning track record, probably the only one who cares enough to be this sneaky",True,True,-1
1940,1,1908,Winter,germany,england,well I'm honestly not invested enough to care if that happens anyway,True,True,1
1941,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,"I‚Äôm not very invested either, but i‚Äôd rather not see italy win, especially if this is how he did it",True,True,-1

1943,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,"Ok, will do. We‚Äôve got a day before the next move",True,True,-1
1944,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,I think,True,True,-1
1945,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,"Ok would you be up for: Paris support Brest Hold, and then get one of your fleets into the channel? And then don't go to Nth as I'll be moving Nth to NWG and Denmark to Nth to make sure he can't break through in the north? Yor holds?",True,True,-1
1946,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,Pic support Brest hold as well would guarantee that he can't take it from the channel.,True,True,-1
1947,1,1908,Winter,germany,england,Pic needs to support paris but other than that Ok,True,True,1

1949,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,I'm supporting paris from brest,NOANNOTATION,True,-1
1950,1,1908,Winter,germany,england,oh right---ok thanks,True,True,1
1951,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,And actually can Yor support Wales?,True,True,-1
1952,1,1908,Winter,germany,england,Yep!,True,True,1
1953,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,Great! Glad we're doing this since I think otherwise italy has a serious shot at 18 by the end of 1910.,True,True,-1
1954,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,"Wait I'm actually doing our moves wrong if we want to hold paris. I need to attack Gas from Bre. Otherwise, Eng cuts Bre support, Gas supports Bur to Par. So I'm going to do that instead.",True,True,-1
1955,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,I'm doing my moves wrong*,True,True,-1
1956,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,"Par to Gas is a good move paired with that. Cuts support for either the Bre or Par attack from Italy, and the armies will bounce right back to where they came from. Up to you though.",True,True,-1
1957,1,1908,Winter,england,germany,Looks like it all worked. A little surprised about the supported move into brest. Do you want it?,True,True,-1
1958,1,1909,Spring,england,germany,"Looking at the board a bit more, we'll have to be clever to keep Italy from any more centers on our side of the board. I think the following will do it: Bre and Par to Gas, Ruh to Bur, channel to MAO, NTH to NWG. We can ask russia to attack Tyr to cut support (Tri is going to fall anyways). I can hold the island as long as Yor doesn't attack me.",True,True,-1
1959,1,1909,Spring,germany,england,"The Brest support was just in case Italy moves Gas into Brest supported by Eng. I should have realized that with Lon moving to Eng that move would not have gone through anyway, but I'm not paying as much attention to this game anymore.",True,True,1

1968,1,1901,Spring,france,germany,"Good point. Sea tiger sounds more menacing anyway.

I was cagey because I still have no sense of who to trust and who not to. But I'd like to trust you if you think you can trust me too. I understand if not because of my unannounced visit to Burgundy...I was just attempting to have some insurance in case there was funny business",False,True,0
1982,1,1901,Winter,france,germany,"Thanks for getting back to me- and no worries. Hopefully when the deadline is moved away from midnight it will be a bit easier lol.

1985,1,1901,Winter,france,germany,"I see. I ask since I have a feeling England might be playing us against eachother. He also asked for support to Belgium Lol. For now I'm building armies, but maybe we can get to a point where we can re-establish a border between us.",True,True,0

Isn't this a huge traffic jam? Wouldn't you be hemming yourself in even more by building armies?

1991,1,1901,Winter,france,germany,"One option for we could consider is that I could dislodge your army and you could choose to remove it from the board. That way, you could build it in a place where you might need it more if you are feeling hemmed-in.",False,True,0

I knew I was making a deal with the devil when I agreed to help England, but England, Italy, Austria, and Russia were/are basically all allied and I figured it was either you or me they turned on. The turning point was when I realized that after I stab England you might not even hold the channel anyway. I couldn't afford to risk fury from all sides.

I just spoke with England and I can confirm that you will be able to take the channel if you want to--they're supporting me into Belgium from Nth. 

I can't be as direct asking this of Italy, but I'm trying to figure out whether they're going to use the lion's share of their force against Marseilles or Spain. If I can figure this out you may have a better chance of holding.

I'm going to send the info your way whether you believe me or not.",True,True,-2
2047,1,1904,Fall,france,germany,Ok. I get that- I'm sorry for not explaining it well. Losing the channel doesn't matter to me. It gives me excellent retreat options and allows me to defend myself against Italy without worrying about what England is up to.,True,True,2

At this point even if I give England all my dots, Italy has enough units to the point where it's locked up. So that's the logical reason, but there's also the fact that England hasn't replied to my messages in over ten seasons and I have evidence of then working closely with Italy.

...and actually, I've been seriously mulling over a backstab of England this turn and I was wondering if you would want to help.

I haven't entirely thought this through, but what do you think?",True,True,1
2109,1,1906,Spring,france,germany,"That sounds great! If we knew English orders, we could potentially come up with an even deadlier plan. I'll have to think more about it, but if England convoys into Brest again, I could move Brest to Picardy to let it in, and bounce NAO. With Italy dislodging MAO, I could then retreat to the Irish Sea and take Liverpool while Paris, Picardy, and Gascony could reclaim Brest. This would have the advantage of not making moves that would give away the stab in the spring.",True,True,-1

And I'm talking with England about their orders right now. They want to take IRI this turn, actually, and want me to support Nth into the channel. If I agree, they actually prefer to move Nwg into Nth than try for Nao. *That's* how unwilling they are to just give me denmark back!",True,True,1
2111,1,1906,Spring,france,germany,"Oh wow, I see. Hmm, well looking at the map I think this would still work. We'd need to find a way to make sure England can't take Holland in the fall (or we could just risk it).

I can still move Brest into the Channel if you want, and if you *really* want to irk England you can move to IRI.

2119,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,"Darn, I missed this message actually, I should have told you what I was planning. I think Italy had Spain guaranteed with MAO-Portugal and Marseilles-Spain with 2 supports. Italy actually then offered me on retreating to the Irish Sea, and in exchange we would collaborate on dislodging the English Channel. I figured it would benefit you as well since this would prevent England from getting off of the island (if they were to convoy to Belgium or something).",True,True,-1

2122,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,"Anyway, you also have a guess- kind of. Not sure about what you've told England about the last moves, but perhaps they will use the North Sea to support Denmark to hold, in which case the support can be cut from Belgium.",True,True,-1
2123,1,1906,Fall,germany,france,"That was one of a few scenarios I was thinking about. But I gotta say, I don't like the idea of Italy in the channel. I thought *you* were going to be there. Did Italy give a reason why they want it?",True,True,1
2124,1,1906,Fall,germany,france,Is it okay if I ask Italy about it?,True,True,1
2125,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,"That's fair. It might be best to not ask Italy directly, but that is up to you (just because it seemed that if Italy is actually serious about this proposal, they would want the element of surprise). Italy wants to do this probably because they want to take the gamble and hope that it will shake up the West a little bit. They didn't actually say that, but it is what I infer.",True,True,-1
2126,1,1906,Fall,germany,france,"I did end up asking...couldn't handle the suspense! And ever since I heard about it I've been wondering if there's some plotting I could do to turn this to my and your advantage at the expense of both Italy and England. Italy said they wouldn't do it if I didn't want them to...I'm thinking I could demand that they use WES to bounce with England in MAO, which then means that the battle for Spain becomes 2 v 2 and you keep it.",True,True,1
2127,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,"That's really clever! We'd have to hope that Italy wouldn't move MAO to Portugal, but otherwise that works well.",True,True,-1
2128,1,1906,Fall,germany,france,"Meanwhile, I could support you into the channel from IRI?",True,True,1
2129,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,Sure,True,True,-1
2130,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,Does that mean you are not going after Denmark?,True,True,-1
2131,1,1906,Fall,germany,france,"Well I'm trying to gauge E's trust of me right now, so I'll see and get back to you",True,True,1
2132,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,Any news?,True,True,-1
2133,1,1906,Fall,germany,france,Are you going to assist Italy into the channel?,True,True,1
2134,1,1906,Fall,germany,france,"England doesn‚Äôt trust me, unfortunately, so I don‚Äôt think I can swing anything clever",True,True,1
2135,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,I probably will. Do you think Italy actually intends to follow through?,NOANNOTATION,True,-1
2136,1,1906,Fall,germany,france,"I think so from talking to them, but I've been wrong before. I've come around to the idea, actually (a weekend away from this game has cleared my head!). So, should I support Brest holding from Paris? Btw, are you going to let me keep Paris?",True,True,1
2137,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,Yep you can stay in Paris. If you can support Brest hold that would be amazing!,True,True,-1
2138,1,1906,Fall,france,germany,I'll submit the orders to support Italy into the channel then and just see what happens,True,True,-1
2139,1,1906,Fall,germany,france,"I'm sorry, France, I made an 11th-hour deal (literally in the past two minutes) with England and Italy. I really really did not mean to deceive you",True,True,1
2140,1,1906,Winter,france,germany,"No worries, it's the game, and I think you made the right choice. As long as you aren't afraid to lie to England/Italy :). I'm rooting for you to do well this game. Congrats on 2 builds!",True,True,-6
2141,1,1906,Winter,germany,france,"Thanks. I've learned a lot from you this game, so thanks for talking with me üòÉ",True,True,6
2142,1,1906,Winter,france,germany,"Happy to. I still have one dot left, and it looks like fleet Picardy will be the most useful to you, but I can keep Gascony or something else as well. Now that all the French centers are gone, you will have to decide between Italy and England.",True,True,-6
2143,1,1906,Winter,germany,france,"I feel like Italy's 10 well-defended units made that decision for me. But even if I change my mind on that, I think Pic would be the most helpful to keep",True,True,6
2144,1,1907,Spring,germany,france,Me and Italy are strategizing now about ousting England from Brest/the channel. Are you more willing to support one of  those two moves?,True,True,6
2145,1,1907,Spring,germany,france,"Actually, we could support you into Brest, then have you support one of us into the channel in Fall?",True,True,6
2146,1,1907,Spring,france,germany,Sure,True,True,-6
2147,1,1907,Spring,france,germany,Moving to Brest right now,True,True,-6
2148,1,1907,Spring,germany,france,Excellent! Do you and Italy have any kind of agreement about Portugal?,True,True,6
2149,1,1907,Spring,france,germany,Well Italy said that they would consider letting me keep it as long as I am useful :),True,True,-6
2150,1,1907,Spring,germany,france,Well this move definitely is. So I hope they keep their word,True,True,6
2151,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,"Nice turn for you! I wonder what England will do at this point. Based on their retreat, it looks like they could be defending London and Edinburgh so a convoy to Yorkshire or possibly even a move to Norway seem like the strongest plays",True,True,-6
2152,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,Can't believe Italy is going to get into Liverpool.,True,True,-6
2153,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,"Anyway, I'm holding in Brest for now, but let me know if I can do something else with that unit.",True,True,-6
2154,1,1907,Fall,germany,france,"yeah that's an unpleasant surprise. Has Italy promised you anything? Based on some things I've pieced together, I'm starting to realize the full extent of their manipulation of this entire game. It's honestly kind of unsettling.

...I hope this can stay between us, France, but I've got two sandboxes up right now: one where I put aside my beef with England just to try and get Italy under control, and one where I keep dancing with the devil, which I will follow through with only on the condition they agree *not* to take one of Liverpool or Portugal this year. Neither of these plans has you staying in Brest. If you're willing to do either of those things (help with an Italy stab or more English destruction) at the expense of Brest, let me know and let me know which you'd prefer. If not, well, that may tip the scales to me staying with Italy, because I don't think we can swing the stab without your help.",True,True,6
2155,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,Happy to order whatever you want.,True,True,-6
2156,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,"I know there's no chance for me to live in this game unless someone else wants it. I think I may have some insight that's worth keeping me around. But if it makes more sense for me to go out now, I'll do it.",True,True,-6
2157,1,1907,Fall,germany,france,"You're good people, France! And I have Italy's word that they're not taking Portugal anytime soon. Though Italy's word is literally not worth the electric current encoding it. 

What insight are you referring to, may I ask?",True,True,6
2158,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,"Thanks. I definitely don't want to see Italy run away with this game. Hmm, well I guess I may be able to offer insight in terms of helping with orders. I'm sure an EGR alliance can stop the AI. Mathematically we will hold 17 centers at the end of this year, which is usually the magic number to prevent a solo since you need 18 to win. Unfortunately, it doesn't leave any leeway to lose ground anywhere and more eyes on the map can be useful.",True,True,-6
2159,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,"I'm assuming Austria can't be turned against Italy. I've tried for the past couple years, even organizing a 3 way convo between Russia, Austria, and I. I don't think Austria is willing to stab Italy.",True,True,-6
2160,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,"I know I said earlier that it would make sense for you to work with Italy, though I've admittedly changed my mind. Especially after the last orders, Italy is nigh unstoppable if you and England fight since Italy will soon reach a critical number of units where they can defeat any opponent. Also, there are no easy stalemate lines in the West to stop them anymore really.",True,True,-6
2161,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,"It's ultimately up to you though. I could see a scenario where you work with Italy to take out England, and a well timed Austria stab of Italy leaves you to establish a strong defense and get a good draw result",True,True,-6
2162,1,1907,Fall,germany,france,"So, that's exactly what Italy has promised me. However, I know for a fact that he's (Italy has lost the courtesy of nonspecific 'they' in my book) been working with England and feeding England my proposed moves for this turn. (Keep that quiet, please!) 
Without revealing that England has been communicating with me, I think I *might* be about to get Italy to confess what he's been doing. He's asked for a half hour to pick his kids up from school (despite my urging that he abandon them and respond to me now), and then he's going to respond. If he confesses, I'm going to side with Italy. In which case I'd like you to move into the channel (where both Bel and Mao [maybe] will support your move). 
If he doesn't, Paris will support you into Gascony. Meanwhile Eng moves IRI and Bel moves Eng. In the north, I convoy to Edi (England's willing to allow me the build this winter) while Eng moves Nwg.",True,True,6
2163,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,Sounds good.,True,True,-6
2164,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,I'm only talking to you at this point. No info will be leaked.,True,True,-6
2165,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,"Convoying to Edi sounds like a good idea. I don't have context on Italy's plan at all, but if I were him I'd probably convoy Gascony into Liverpool",True,True,-6
2166,1,1907,Fall,germany,france,Italy is vile and even if we all die doing it I want to see him minorly inconvenienced. I‚Äôd like to move forward with the anti-italian plan and support you into Gas,True,True,6
2167,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,Done,NOANNOTATION,True,-6
2168,1,1907,Fall,germany,france,"Since we (me and England) think that Italy's going to try the convoy from Gas to Lvp, we actually think it's better to try and have you disrupt Mao. Eng will support you into Mao. Sorry for the late-breaking change.",True,True,6
2169,1,1907,Fall,france,germany,Ok,True,True,-6
2170,1,1907,Winter,germany,france,"Good game, France! Thanks for everything!",True,True,7
2171,1,1907,Winter,france,germany,GG! Good luck!,True,True,-7
2172,1,1901,Spring,austria,russia,"Hello there! What's your general plan for this game? My inclination when I play Austria is to piss off as few people as possible, so I don't plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn.",True,True,-1
2173,1,1901,Spring,russia,austria,"Hey hey!  
Don't really have much of a plan yet - like you, I generally try not to piss off too many people at the start until I get a feel for the lay of the board, so my general decision at start is really just Mos -> Ukr|StP .  Right now my default inclination is to go Ukr and try to get Rum, that may change as I talk to other players.  Happy to talk about trying to take that with fleet or army depending on how spring goes, and certainly not looking to commit to any particular long-term growth direction right now.  That being said, A/R is one of my favorite duos (R/F is up there too, but I don't think I've ever even seriously tried to pull that off in an online game - that's a FtF option where I know the players üòÉ ).  
I'm assuming standard Galicia bounce right now. happy to discuss other options.",True,True,1
2174,1,1901,Spring,austria,russia,"Yeah, I was figuring standard Galicia bounce too. Keeps both of us honest.",True,True,-1
2175,1,1901,Spring,austria,russia,"So, here's my pitch: I have been on both sides of the deal when Austria, Italy, and Russia decide that everything would be simpler if there wasn't a Turkey. Every time, things have indeed been simpler for A/I/R. So, whaddya think? Wanna simplify our game?",True,True,-1
2176,1,1901,Spring,russia,austria,I literally just told Italy to go after Turkey first. üòÄ,True,True,1

2179,1,1902,Spring,russia,austria,"They free people of rumania depend on your good will. I assume he's going to force Black, so... That would actually leave him pretty exposed to you and Italy should you so desire.",True,True,0
2180,1,1902,Spring,austria,russia,"I certainly won't be helping him take Rum, so I think you can survive this.",True,True,0
2181,1,1902,Spring,austria,russia,"Well it looks like that worked great! I'm in a position to force Bulgaria, you're getting Sev back, and you'll be set to keep Rum. I'd appreciate it if you could support Greece to Bulgaria.",True,True,0
2182,1,1902,Spring,russia,austria,"Oh, I didn't reply yet, did I?  Yes, I can give that support.",True,True,0
2183,1,1902,Spring,russia,austria,"And if feel bad, except Turkey didn't even reach out to me even once last season to try and pitch something like blowing up my fleet to try and work together later on - just completely went radio silent after the setup",NOANNOTATION,True,0
2184,1,1902,Fall,austria,russia,"Yeah, Turkey has not been handling this fantastically.",True,True,0
2185,1,1902,Winter,russia,austria,I assume the Greece swap wasn't negotiated?,True,True,1

2196,1,1903,Fall,austria,russia,"Heh. So, you taking Ankara?",True,True,-1
2197,1,1903,Fall,russia,austria,Planning on it. Then it's mostly a matter of seeing where England/France take their relationship.,True,True,1
2198,1,1903,Fall,austria,russia,"Yeah, they seems to have a bit of a clusterfuck going on. Should be fun to watch, at least üòõ",True,True,-1

2200,1,1903,Fall,austria,russia,"Sure, works for me.",True,True,-1

2206,1,1903,Fall,russia,austria,"Yeah, sorry - good call on your part, as I was already asleep by the time you sent that. 
I want to go deal with England now, to be honest. The question is what do you want -you're the one who needs an obvious path to move in.",True,True,1

2208,1,1903,Winter,austria,russia,"I wholeheartedly support you going after England. I think my most long term success comes from going after Italy, so I'm going to build an army in Trieste and let Italy go get engaged with France while I come after him.",True,False,-1
2209,1,1904,Spring,russia,austria,"I'm building army Sebastopol for the obvious defense - assuming you do build in Trieste, will take steps to demilitarize that border (no move to Galicia or otherwise in your direction, cooperate on Smyrna, moving units away as soon as possible)",True,True,1
2210,1,1904,Spring,russia,austria,"Ball's in your court - I never really understood the strategy of lying on the builds, as there's little payoff to it generally, but we are where we are.

2264,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,I'm slightly concerned about this being kept confidential.,True,True,-2
2265,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,"Can you agree to keep what I say confidential regardless of what I say? (obviously only talking in-game stuff, not about to confess to a murder or something)",True,True,-2
2266,1,1905,Spring,austria,england,Absolutely. What's up?,True,True,2
2267,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,"1) Italy is telling us both that we‚Äôre his true long-term ally. 2) Italy is the highest-rated player on playdiplomacy.com . I don‚Äôt think either of those things are necessarily relevant this year, but I wanted you to be aware.",True,True,-2
2268,1,1905,Spring,austria,england,"Ahaaaa, good to know.",True,True,2
2269,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,"Also, if I'm going to weaken the Russian line to let you in, we'll need to come to some agreements first.",True,True,-2
2270,1,1905,Spring,austria,england,Whatcha got in mind?,True,True,2
2271,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,"Nothing this Spring, so don't worry about anything last second. I'll message back after we see the moves.",True,True,-2
2272,1,1905,Spring,austria,england,Sounds good.,True,True,2
2273,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,I haven't done all the math yet. Does he have a guarantee to hold Rum? That was messier than I expected.,True,True,-2
2274,1,1905,Spring,austria,england,"I don't believe he does. I've got quite a few on it, and the ability to cut a lot of supports.",True,True,2
2275,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,"You'll need to coordinate with Italy to do the bounce in Ser to prevent the retreat there, but yeah I think you're right.",True,True,-2
2276,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,"Scratch that, Italy's not in Tri anymore.",True,True,-2
2277,1,1905,Spring,austria,england,"Yeah, and I'm retreating to Ser. Thing I gotta worry about is that Boh army walking into Vienna.",True,True,2
2278,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,"Oh yeah, I should be paying more attention. Actually I should probably be sleeping. Yeah that's a risk.",True,True,-2
2279,1,1905,Spring,austria,england,"Sleep is a good idea, I'm heading that way myself. This weekend was great but very tiring.",True,True,2
2280,1,1905,Spring,england,austria,"(Btw italy claims he is not, in fact, the highest rated player on playdiplomacy.com, and that this is just a rumor made up by France. But his username does happen to be the same. Not that any of this is that important, but it‚Äôs interesting)",NOANNOTATION,True,-2
2281,1,1907,Winter,england,austria,Looks like we might have a common enemy in italy. Sorry about the stab there.,NOANNOTATION,True,3
2282,1,1908,Spring,england,austria,"Reply all to Italy's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the ""Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders"" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.",True,True,3
2283,1,1908,Spring,austria,england,"I got it, I'm in for the draw.",True,True,-3
2284,1,1908,Winter,austria,england,"So, did you veto the draw?",True,True,-3
2285,1,1908,Winter,england,austria,"No. If you‚Äôre asking everybody this, can you let me know what you hear back? I texted the admin to see if 1) draw settings are somehow disabled and 2) if 1909 is still going to be the last year. Part of me thinks maybe italy is turning down the draw. Make people think the game is over and then still try to scoop up centers",True,True,3
2286,1,1908,Winter,austria,england,"I have, in fact, asked everyone. Thus far, Russia and Germany say they didn't veto.",True,True,-3
2287,1,1908,Winter,england,austria,"Yeah. I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs out of the question that draws are disabled (though i don‚Äôt know the site well enough to know whether this would be obvious to us i.e. draw settings disabled). But like if you‚Äôre running a study and want to get data, maybe you make it so people can‚Äôt end the game early and get their $25 right away.",True,True,3
2288,1,1908,Winter,austria,england,"I *think* it would be obvious? Also, actually, the option to disable draws is very new. Let me look and see if they tweeted about when it was introduced, as compared to when the game started.",True,True,-3
2289,1,1908,Winter,austria,england,"Looks like the game was created just after the option was instituted, so maybe it's in place? I think it would probably be more obvious it was enabled, however.",True,True,-3
2290,1,1908,Winter,england,austria,"Yeah. Well, I‚Äôll let you know when I hear back from the admin. I feel like italy is the only one with the incentive to not draw. If everyone gets lazy on their moves, he can try to keep scooping up centers.",True,True,3
2291,1,1908,Winter,england,austria,"Well, best of luck holding on through 1910. Seems like you'll make it as long as russia is a friend.",True,True,3
2292,1,1901,Spring,austria,turkey,"Hello there! What's your general plan for this game? My inclination when I play Austria is to piss off as few people as possible, so I don't plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn.",True,True,0
2293,1,1901,Spring,turkey,austria,I suggest containment of Russia at the very least and perhaps his destruction,True,True,0
2294,1,1901,Spring,austria,turkey,"That certainly sounds just fine to me. I think Turkey and Austria can make for a very good alliance - you build a bunch of fleets, I build a bunch of armies, and we crush a bunch of dots.",NOANNOTATION,True,0
2295,1,1901,Spring,turkey,austria,Ok lets roll I‚Äôll go north for the opening,NOANNOTATION,True,0
2296,1,1901,Fall,turkey,austria,If you want to contain Russia I am willing to support you into rum if you want to wait that‚Äôs ok too,True,False,0
2297,1,1901,Fall,austria,turkey,"I'd love the support, thanks.",False,False,0
2298,1,1901,Fall,turkey,austria,Done,True,False,0
2299,1,1901,Fall,turkey,austria,Ok,True,False,0
2300,1,1901,Winter,turkey,austria,However nothing bad came if it and I still think we can work together your thoughts?,NOANNOTATION,True,0
2301,1,1901,Spring,austria,france,"Hi France! I don't think we have a ton to talk about yet, but if you're planning to go in against Italy that's certainly something I'd like to know.",True,True,0
2302,1,1901,Spring,france,austria,Thanks for reaching out. How do you generally feel about working with Italy?,True,True,0
2303,1,1901,Spring,austria,france,"If Italy wants it, it can be a powerful alliance, but in my experience Italy rarely wants it badly enough.",True,True,0
2304,1,1901,Spring,france,austria,"That's true, and my experience as well. It's tricky since if he's not going after me or yoy, then what are his plans? If Italy isn't planning to Lepanto then it is worrying for one of us",True,True,0
2305,1,1901,Spring,austria,france,"Well I haven't heard *too* much from Italy yet, but once I find out more about his current intentions I will certainly let you know.",True,False,0
2306,1,1901,Fall,france,austria,"Nice, things are looking up for you with the Russia/Turkey conflict and a seemingly friendly Italy.",True,True,0
2307,1,1901,Fall,austria,france,"Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good right now.",True,True,0
2308,1,1902,Spring,france,austria,Has Russia been talking to you? I imagine he may have reached out given the builds we're seeing here.,True,True,0
2309,1,1902,Spring,austria,france,"On and off, yeah. We're coordinating some.",True,True,0
2310,1,1902,Spring,france,austria,"Nice. Given England and Germany seem to be working together now, it may be wise to prop up Russia so that they don't take all of Scandinavia and split me up. If you or Italy can spare some armies north that would be great as well!",True,True,0
2311,1,1902,Spring,austria,france,I'll see what I can do.,True,False,0
2312,1,1902,Spring,france,austria,thanks!,NOANNOTATION,True,0
2313,1,1903,Spring,austria,france,"F Bre, eh? I'm curious what you're gonna do with that.",True,True,-1
2314,1,1903,Spring,austria,france,"I figure you can't be too happy with F LON, either.",True,True,-1
2315,1,1903,Spring,france,austria,It's made stranger by how I can't seem to contact England at the moment. I hope to work things out with them diplomatically if I can.,True,True,1
2316,1,1903,Spring,austria,france,"I reached out to England as well, I'll let you know what I hear.",True,True,-1

2318,1,1903,Spring,austria,france,"(I don't think that, but France said it)",NOANNOTATION,True,-1
2319,1,1903,Fall,france,austria,Thank you for the warnings about England. I'm in a much better defensive position now.,True,True,1
2320,1,1903,Fall,france,austria,What are your thoughts on your relationship with Italy?,True,True,1
2321,1,1903,Fall,austria,france,"Well he didn't tell me about the Tyrolia move, which I'm not, y'know, entirely pleased about.",True,True,-1
2322,1,1903,Fall,france,austria,Italy didn't tell me either.,True,True,1
2323,1,1903,Fall,austria,france,Good to know.,True,True,-1
2324,1,1904,Winter,france,austria,Damn. The no build hurts,NOANNOTATION,True,-2
2325,1,1905,Spring,france,austria,Are you going to do something about Italy at some point? There's no way Italy has your best interests at heart. Italy and England are big buddies and my guess is that Italy has been getting England and Russia together. The amount of trust there when England could have taken St Petersburg and Sweden is ridiculous. That's also why Italy swiped Trieste from you: making builds extremely difficult for you.,NOANNOTATION,True,-2
2326,1,1905,Spring,france,austria,I can't hold off Italy for much longer. Italy is going to start exploding in terms of builds very soon and you are going to be taking steps backwards as long as England props up Russia. Shouldn't Italy share some of those spoils with you? I think you should ask Italy for Trieste back or Greece back. You need those builds way more than Italy does.,NOANNOTATION,True,-2
2327,1,1906,Winter,france,austria,"If it were me, I don't think it is fair that Italy has 10 supply centers and you have 6. When I was trying to work with Italy, Italy demanded I gave him one supply center each year. Looks like they are doing the same with you. I dunno, seems kind of draconian if you ask me.",True,True,-5
2328,1,1906,Winter,france,austria,Maybe you can ask for Trieste back?,True,True,-5
2329,1,1906,Winter,austria,france,There are discussions ongoing regarding balancing things out with me picking up some of the eastern dots.,True,True,5
2330,1,1906,Winter,france,austria,Are you aware of Italy manufacturing the agreement for England leaving Russia alone in Sweden and St. Petersburg?,True,True,-5
2331,1,1906,Winter,austria,france,"That's what I've been told by England, but I'm not sure how much to believe it.",NOANNOTATION,True,5
2332,1,1907,Spring,france,austria,I know you trust Italy a ton and it's clear you have a great relationship. So this must be really hard to hear. But you have to stab Italy this turn or he soloes. Germany and England are fighting and I'm Italy's janissary. No stalemate lines in sight. You won't get another chance after this.,True,True,-5
2333,1,1907,Winter,france,austria,"My gift to you is willingly suiciding so that England and Germany have a chance to stop Italy in the West. Please don't waste it, though I won't be there to see it üôÇ .",NOANNOTATION,True,-3
2334,1,1901,Spring,russia,england,"Good morning!  Best of luck to you, and let me know how we can best avoid any unnecessary and unproductive entanglements.  üòÉ",True,True,1
2335,1,1901,Spring,england,russia,"Best of luck to you as well! I'm likely opening north and I have my eye on Norway for the fall. However, this may be dependent on some discussion with France. Can I ask where you're planning to send your Moscow army this Spring?",True,True,-1
2336,1,1901,Spring,russia,england,"My initial inclination is to focus on the South.  I do have to weigh that over concerns of you opening full north, but hopefully we can stay on the same page.  I am of course much happier if you indicate you're going to put a fleet in Nwy.",NOANNOTATION,True,1
2337,1,1901,Spring,england,russia,"That's fair enough. I'm talking to France now about Belgium, as my army is pretty useless just hanging around the island. I can't commit to leaving my army off of Nwy just yet. Let me get back to you when I hear from France about Belgium.",True,True,-1
2338,1,1901,Spring,russia,england,Sounds great.  Good luck in your French negotiations!,True,True,1
2339,1,1901,Spring,england,russia,"Belgium definitely on the table but still not confirmed. Germany is acting like a big hot-head btw. Threatening war from the outset. If they don't calm down, maybe we can talk about helping you into Denmark next year.",True,True,-1
2340,1,1901,Fall,england,russia,"HI, I may be sending an army to Norway this fall, as it looks like France is trying to go to Belgium. However, I have no intention of going to St. Petersburg. I'd actually be more interested in Denmark, if you'd be willing to support that. This would be on the condition that I would help you into Berlin by cutting support in Kiel.",True,True,-1
2341,1,1901,Fall,russia,england,"No worries, mate - we're looking fine, so you do what you need to do üòÉ",True,True,1
2342,1,1901,Fall,england,russia,"Alright, well we can chat about Denmark next year then.",True,True,-1
2343,1,1901,Winter,england,russia,"Hi, sorry to see the trouble with Turkey. Let's have a chat about St. Petersburg and Denmark.",True,True,-1
2344,1,1901,Winter,russia,england,"Shouldn't be too much worry üòä
I'm certainly not looking to start any issues with you. What are you thinking about Denmark?",True,True,1
2345,1,1901,Winter,england,russia,"I don't know your thoughts on aggression against Germany at this juncture, but either of us could support the other into Denmark. This would likely cause a disband since I suspect Kiel will be occupied.",True,True,-1
2346,1,1901,Winter,russia,england,"I'm not necessarily opposed, as long as my other border gets priority attention üòÉ",True,True,1
2347,1,1902,Spring,russia,england,"Ok, all things being equal, I'm not opposed to popping Denmark, especially if you use the move to back off one of those northern units.",NOANNOTATION,True,1
2348,1,1902,Spring,england,russia,"So, like vacate Norway? Or would you be on board with convoy army to denmark and then move NWG to Nwy?",True,True,-1
2349,1,1902,Spring,england,russia,"My preferred move would be Nth to Den, and Lon to Nth, but I understand if that seems a bit aggressive.",True,True,-1
2350,1,1902,Spring,russia,england,"I was thinking either nwy to den with nwg going to Norway, or the fleets in, filling North from Norwegian, but either way. I'll be driving for a couple hours, so you have a little time to think and let me know who the mover is.",True,True,1
2351,1,1902,Spring,russia,england,Back online - final decision on mover?,True,True,1
2352,1,1902,Spring,england,russia,I'm going for it in fall. Will you still be in Sweden?,True,False,-1
2353,1,1902,Spring,russia,england,"I will.  Will you still be in Norway?  If so, I'm inclined to order Swe -> Nwy just to build trust with Germany.",True,True,1
2354,1,1902,Spring,england,russia,Go for it.  I'll support hold from NWG just in case.,True,True,-1
2355,1,1902,Spring,england,russia,Actually the support hold is unnecessary. Some reason I was thinking Denmark could theoretically support you in. I may do it anyways for kicks.,True,True,-1
2356,1,1902,Spring,russia,england,I wasn't going to point out there was no possible support on Norway.  üòÄ,True,True,1
2357,1,1902,Spring,england,russia,Hi! Looks like it was a productive Spring for you. Are you still on board to support me into Denmark? I imagine that Germany will be looking for a friend in you.,NOANNOTATION,True,-1
2358,1,1902,Spring,russia,england,"Yep. Just tell me the mover. I'd somewhat prefer it to be Norway, for obvious reasons",True,True,1
2359,1,1902,Spring,england,russia,Plan is to convoy norway army to denmark and move NWG to Norway.,True,True,-1
2360,1,1902,Spring,england,russia,Sound good to you?,True,True,-1
2361,1,1902,Spring,russia,england,"Sounds great to me. Happy hunting!
Next year I should be able to drop to Baltic if you want to keep pushing",NOANNOTATION,True,1
2362,1,1902,Fall,england,russia,"Great. I've entered my moves in. NWG to Nwy, Nwy to Den, NTH convoy Nwy to Den, HEL to Kie. So I'll be expecting Swe support Nwy to Den from you.",True,True,-1
2363,1,1902,Fall,russia,england,"(checking)
Yep, order's in the box!",True,True,1
2364,1,1903,Spring,england,russia,"Hi, thanks for the help into Denmark! What‚Äôs your plan in the north for this year?",True,True,-1
2365,1,1903,Spring,russia,england,Was debating whether to drop into the Baltic,True,True,1
2366,1,1903,Spring,russia,england,Any thoughts? You looking to keep pushing on Germany?,True,True,1
2367,1,1903,Spring,england,russia,"It‚Äôs a little complicated. I‚Äôm starting to worry about a stab from france after the build in brest. If i can focus on it, we‚Äôre probably talking getting me into kiel and you into berlin.",True,True,-1
2368,1,1903,Spring,russia,england,"Ok, I'll play it loose",True,True,1
2369,1,1903,Spring,england,russia,I‚Äôll keep you posted if my plans solidify,True,True,-1
2370,1,1903,Fall,england,russia,Great minds think alike! Shall we have a chat before our Spring moves?,True,True,-1
2371,1,1903,Fall,russia,england,Indeed.,True,True,1
2372,1,1904,Spring,russia,england,So... Moving forward. How do you want to handle this?,NOANNOTATION,True,2
2373,1,1904,Spring,england,russia,"Well, what are your intentions on the German front this year?",NOANNOTATION,True,-2
2374,1,1904,Spring,russia,england,"To be perfectly Frank, looks like my attention is needed to the South. The couple units up north can be flexible in their use.",True,True,2
2375,1,1904,Spring,england,russia,I'd be happy to repeat the same bounce we just did twice this year. Does that tie up units you'd like to send elsewhere?,True,True,-2
2376,1,1904,Spring,russia,england,"Nope, that's fine for this season. We can reevaluate when we see what the rest of the board does",True,True,2

2387,1,1905,Spring,england,russia,"Well, you need to make sure Germany doesn't cut support in Sil, right?",NOANNOTATION,True,0
2388,1,1905,Spring,england,russia,Also germany needs to not take that fleet to sweden,True,True,0
2389,1,1905,Spring,russia,england,True.,True,True,0
2390,1,1905,Spring,england,russia,I'm also thinking a bit long term for you. That next build probably comes from Germany. But you also need my help to get it. And I'm pretty friendly with germany right now.,True,True,0
2391,1,1905,Spring,russia,england,"To be perfectly frank, I'm kinda happy being a stone wall for the moment. And make no mistake -there's potential for some fun fuckery on my part down south",True,True,0

2393,1,1905,Spring,england,russia,Rum?,True,True,0
2394,1,1905,Spring,russia,england,"If they screw up, yes. More likely the count stays static but they have to keep scrambling and keep their units tied up there",True,True,0

2399,1,1907,Spring,england,russia,"Hey, just wanted to check in and see how things were going. I‚Äôve been enjoying our friendly north so far.",True,True,0
2400,1,1907,Spring,russia,england,"Boring at the moment, but steady. Either Austria will realize his ass is hanging in the wind or Italy will get greedy, and either way the front opens up.",NOANNOTATION,True,0
2401,1,1907,Winter,russia,england,"Oh, gdi. Yes, I realize you need the build",True,True,-1
2402,1,1907,Winter,england,russia,"Yeah sorry to open the floor to discussion with a stab. I did need the build, and getting two was far from a guarantee for me (even though it turned out that way). I think we have a lot to discuss. How are you feeling about the state of the board?",True,True,1
2403,1,1907,Winter,russia,england,"I'm kinda happy there's finally some movement, to be honest. And Austria's finally responding to messages after a two year silence. I think we're on a stop the leader phase which does have some opportunities for us, specifically",True,True,-1
2404,1,1907,Winter,england,russia,"I agree. Running through some tactics, I see that Italy can hold his western dots until he's forced to disband. I think we'll need to see two disbands, maybe three, before we can break through.",True,True,1
2405,1,1908,Spring,england,russia,"Hi. Given that the beta test ends in 1909, wanted to check in about your goals (i.e. thoughts on a draw?)",True,True,1
2406,1,1908,Spring,russia,england,"To be honest, I totally forgot about the end date.  I dunno - the only person who can even theoretically be removed by then is Austria, so we'll just see how that shakes out",True,True,-1
2407,1,1908,Spring,england,russia,"Yeah I think he said 1910 if we really wanted. But we are just the beta test. Italy austria and I have agreed on a 5-way draw. Germany wants to play out, but might be swayed if everyone else is on board.",True,True,1
2408,1,1908,Spring,russia,england,"Ah, good point - I have the draw set now.",True,True,-1
2409,1,1908,Spring,england,russia,"Me too. Do you know how the draws get resolved? Germany is the last hold-out, and I think she's skeptical that she'll get duped somehow if she sets it as such. I thought it's just that play proceeds as normal unless everybody agrees to the same thing.",True,True,1
2410,1,1908,Spring,russia,england,"That's correct - it will only pass if it's unanimous, or at least until everyone's draw setting is compatible.  For example, if four set it as four way draw, and one set as surrender, that's compatible with a four way draw excluding the surrendering power",True,True,-1

Seriously, no real opinion formed yet.  He was first to reach out, standard fairly neutral greeting and fishing for info, noncommittal on plans  beyond bouncing Galicia and trying not to anger any of his neighbors.  I could go either way on that one.  Life is a little easier for us if we clear that early.

2430,1,1901,Spring,russia,france,Not especially - depends on how squirrelly the English player comes off in initial negotiations.  So far he's scanning as moderately squirrelly üòÉ,True,True,1

2435,1,1901,Fall,france,russia,Looking good for you since you will be able to pick up Sweden. The lack of northern German prescence might mean a greater opportunity in Scandinavia for you. What were your thoughts about turkey's move to Armenia?,NOANNOTATION,True,-1

2447,1,1903,Fall,france,russia,"Yeah, I feel that too. With England withdrawing I'm assuming you are no longer hitting Germany with your units, unless you have Italian help. If that is the case I might also stop aggravating Germany",True,True,0

2452,1,1904,Winter,france,russia,"I am starting to get frustrated with England, who has not replied to my messages for over a year while clowning around instead of helping stop the Italy Austria alliance. What's stopping me from throwing is Germany asking me not to. And then she took Belgium, lol.",True,True,0
2453,1,1904,Winter,france,russia,Not sure what my game plan is here. Right now I'm working on getting Germany to build a fleet. My theory is that if Germany can pivot towards England then it may be a salvageable game. Eliminating England ASAP and there's a possibility we can end up in a draw once AI tensions build. But that is impossible if they see a weak north full of infighting that they can just roll over- then they have no reason to ever turn on eachother.,True,True,0
2454,1,1904,Winter,russia,france,"Yep.  I have the south stopped cold at this point - and I told Austria after the Winter turn they would get two and then be stuck - but that means y'all gotta work your shit out and lock the other side, or this is an AI steamroll",True,True,0

2462,1,1901,Spring,england,france,Bonjour! Let's talk about the English channel!,True,True,0
2463,1,1901,Spring,france,england,Sure! What are your thoughts on it?,True,True,0
2464,1,1901,Spring,england,france,I'd like to leave it unoccupied. A fight early on is bad for both of us.,True,True,0
2465,1,1901,Spring,france,england,"Makes sense. I agree, a DMZ is good for us both. I know that getting armies off of the island is pretty important for you. Depending on how it plays out we could talk about Belgium. Any thoughts on your other neighbors Germany and Russia?",True,True,0
2466,1,1901,Spring,england,france,"Cool, I'd like to then agree now to a DMZ in the channel through the end of 1902, and we can re-discuss that year about future plans. Are you on board? If so, will your fleet go to MAO?

Haven't heard from Germany yet. I've been honest with Russia about going north, and Russia has expressed some concerns. Doesn't want me to bring my army to Nwy. So, Belgium may be a home I'm interested in if that's on the table.",True,True,0
2467,1,1901,Spring,england,france,Wow Germany threatens war with me in the first message haha,True,True,0
2468,1,1901,Spring,france,england,"Yes, and yes. I will open to MAO. If Russia is adamantly against you putting an army in Norway, it might be worth it to not antagonize him provided that Russia and Germany are not working together. Belgium is definitely on the table",True,True,0
2469,1,1901,Spring,france,england,"Interesting haha, that is unusual",True,True,0
2470,1,1901,Spring,england,france,"Yeah, something tells me that player may be a little unpredictable. Sounds good on the agreement.

For Belgium, is there something you would want from me for you to give that up? Are you saying you may consider supporting me in? I don't think Germany will be thrilled about me being there.",True,True,0
2471,1,1901,Spring,france,england,"Yes, depending on how the spring plays out I may be in a position to support you into Belgium. I don't think it would be conditional on something you do, but rather if it makes sense given the positions in the Fall. Maybe building an army in London rather than a fleet, which likely compliments your goals anyway given the channel DMZ. I think you are right in that Germany would not want to see you in Belgium. If it will antagonize him anyway, it might make sense for us to launch a full out assault in the Fall (this would probably look like bouncing Holland to weaken the German position).",NOANNOTATION,True,0
2472,1,1901,Spring,england,france,"All of that makes sense. Let's revisit before the fall orders then. I wouldn't be totally opposed to the idea of an attack on Germany, especially if he's not willing to engage in any meaningful discussion.",True,True,0
2473,1,1901,Spring,england,france,FYI Germany has indicated he is taking his fleet to Holland in the Spring.,True,True,0
2474,1,1901,Spring,france,england,"Thanks for the heads up! That is an interesting choice, I think it may indicate a Russia/Germany agreement of some kind as it means Russia will be getting Sweden.",True,True,0
2475,1,1901,Spring,england,france,"Yeah, you may be right. Have you heard from Germany at all? Or Russia?",True,True,0
2476,1,1901,Spring,france,england,"I have, but nothing much. Seems like they are withholding information from me.",NOANNOTATION,True,0
2477,1,1901,Spring,england,france,"Yeah I'm not getting much from them either. In a remote game it's hard to tell if people are being quiet on purpose or just not making themselves available on the chat. (This is my first time playing remote, so a bit of a different experience for me).",True,True,0
2478,1,1901,Spring,france,england,"Yeah, that is definitely one of the downsides of online diplomacy. By the way, we're still good with the channel, right? I know you must be anxious if Germany and Russia are not talking to you much, but I have to stress that this is not because I am working with them, and I am not moving to the channel.",True,True,0
2479,1,1901,Spring,england,france,"I am not going to the channel. We've agreed to keep out at least through the end of 1902, and I plan to uphold this.

2480,1,1901,Spring,france,england,That wasn't my intention at all and I am very glad that we are on the same page. Sorry if it came across like I don't trust you: I trust you which is why I hoped to bring up any potential worries before they happen. I could have worded it better üòÖ .,True,True,0
2481,1,1901,Spring,england,france,No worries. I did click the thumbs up on your message haha. Just wanted to be clear about the consequences of a stab.,True,True,0

2483,1,1901,Fall,england,france,Glad to see our commitment upheld. Seems like you may have your sights set on Belgium.,True,True,0
2484,1,1901,Fall,france,england,"Likewise! The rest of the map has been interesting. What's your read on the map? For me, I think that a supported attack on Belgium is likely the move given the spring turn.",NOANNOTATION,True,0
2485,1,1901,Fall,england,france,"My read: Germany gets a pretty good start, facing only a bit of aggression from you.. Austria and Turkey are likely agreed to stand strong against Russia. However, I think there's a chance that Turkey is sort of overselling their ""opposition"" to Russia moving to Arm. There may be a juggernaut alliance in the works. Probably no real conflict between Austria and Italy. Maybe they'll bounce in Trieste. Austria has a pretty good start if he can secure Greece.",True,True,0
2486,1,1901,Fall,england,france,Do you plan to take Belgium from Pic or Bur?,True,True,0
2487,1,1901,Fall,france,england,"This is all true. I think I will likely be taking it from Picardy, but I'm not sure yet.",NOANNOTATION,True,0
2488,1,1901,Fall,england,france,And here I thought Belgium was on the table. I guess it's already on your plate then? What's to stop me from working with the Germans to keep you out?,True,True,0
2489,1,1901,Fall,france,england,"Belgium IS on the table. But I didn't expect these spring moves, and with the way the map looks, I think you need to convince me that it would be worth it for me to be on 4 with you on 5. Totally different discussion if Italy is in Tyrolia, or if Germany bounced me out of Burgundy",False,True,0
2490,1,1901,Fall,france,england,"I'm looking at it from your point of view too, I think you have options other than Belgium, right? You could take Denmark for example.",False,True,0
2491,1,1901,Fall,england,france,"I can't take Denmark by force, and Germany isn't keen on letting me have it. The way I see it you'll easily take Portugal next year (assuming you go Spain s.c. with your fleet). And that line on Pic-Bur-Mar (assuming you build there) would make you really strong. Meanwhile I'm struggling to find a fifth supply center next year. Russia probably helps out germany with Denmark. So I'm looking at St. Petersburg at that point?",True,True,0
2492,1,1901,Fall,england,france,What can you offer to balance this out if I let you in?,True,True,0
2493,1,1901,Fall,france,england,"I've had some time to think about it since the bot was down, and you are right about concerns over fairness. At the end of the day, the plan doesn't matter unless you are on board with it. If you are going to demand Belgium I'd rather support you in than bounce with you.",True,True,0
2494,1,1901,Fall,france,england,"If you can forgo Belgium this turn, we do have an opportunity to put you into Holland and/or Denmark next year, and that will quickly snowball into Scandinavia, Kiel, etc.",False,True,0
2495,1,1901,Fall,england,france,You're suggesting I get a fleet in NTH and HEL? I think that's the only way to make that work. I would want no fleet built in Bre and our DMZ extended through at least the end of 1903. And probably one other country on board with the takedown. If we're stabbing Germany we should make sure she's taken out swiftly.,True,True,0
2496,1,1901,Fall,france,england,"I think that's the best way to do it, yeah. I agree to no fleet build in Brest and an extension to our DMZ to the end of 1903. The one thing I cannot guarantee is another country involved in the take down, but the best suspects would likely be Russia followed by Italy.",True,True,0
2497,1,1901,Fall,england,france,"Yeah, I was thinking Russia. This may be something to talk about next year, as we're running out of time here.",True,True,0
2498,1,1901,Fall,france,england,"Cool. I am happy to broach the subject when we are ready to. Especially if this turn goes well, he may be more inclined to help next year.",True,True,0
2499,1,1901,Fall,england,france,Hmm what if germany bumps me in Nth or HEL?,True,True,0
2500,1,1901,Fall,france,england,"I was thinking this, and if you supported yourself into the North Sea through Norway you would just have to worry about being bounced out of Hel, which I think would be highly unlikely unless the plan is leaked. But the other option that is perhaps safer would be to move to Skaggerak, which Germany can't bounce",NOANNOTATION,True,0
2501,1,1901,Fall,england,france,"I really don't think it's that unlikely. That Holland fleet has two places to go, and I expect it to move.

2502,1,1901,Fall,england,france,"This is too big a risk for me. My preferred move is to Belgium. I understand this may warrant doing a couple of favors for your next year in return.

2507,1,1901,Winter,england,france,"Yeah, i actually botched my move because i forgot to click submit in the browser :/. Not that it would have made a difference. Hope you‚Äôre enjoying Belgium.",False,True,-1
2508,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"I didn't expect to get Belgium. I incorrectly inferred from all the information I had that Germany would support you into Belgium and tap Burgundy, so in order to not lose the support I decided to make Burgundy the mover.",True,True,1
2509,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"I mean. If anything, you are in a better position for not having moved there. I'm surprised it was a misorder. You've successfully put Germany and I into conflict and can pick off the remains.",False,True,1
2510,1,1901,Winter,france,england,Another note. I would have put you into Belgium without hesitation if it was an army OR if I knew that Germany was not planning to support you in with Holland.,False,True,1
2511,1,1901,Winter,england,france,"Yeah i‚Äôm not really buying that i‚Äôm the big winner here, so you can save your breath. If you want an ally against germany, I‚Äôd like to start hearing some ideas about what that relationship looks like.",True,True,-1
2512,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"Not saying you are the big winner, I'm saying that your misorder was probably a good thing. Before we get into the details of an alliance against Germany, I think it's worth noting that the AI alliance is going to absolutely roll over Russia/Turkey, and so if you take Russia's dots that are easy to take, I think it will be helping Germany/Austria/Italy more than it helps you.",True,True,1
2513,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"I really think that we should get Russia on board, and it should be super easy to do. Just say that as long as Sweden helps you take Denmark, you won't take StP or Sweden for the time being. We could even put Russia into Denmark.",True,True,1
2514,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"I dunno if we actually have so much to work together on. If you build fleets and attack the coast, I'll be distracting all his armies. I need to devote all my resources to containing Germany's armies anyway. I think you guarantee Denmark next turn if we're clever about it.",True,True,1
2515,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"If Germany builds Fleet Kiel, we can support a convoy into Holland. But I think he'll be building armies- that's just intuition, I haven't been able to reach Germany and he's hard to talk to.",False,False,1
2516,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"Long term I think this looks like a Russia holding off Austria/Italy with Turkey being lepantoed, and then if we hit Germany hard with Russian help then we have a good shot of making it to the midgame and preventing AI from 2-way the board.",True,True,1
2517,1,1901,Winter,england,france,Ok I'll respond over a few messages so I don't kill the bot.,True,True,-1
2518,1,1901,Winter,england,france,"I agree Russia and Turkey are in trouble, but I think Russia is more vulnerable. I actually think it's possible that Turkey and Austria are friendly. Maybe the lepanto will be set up but won't come to fruition. If I were to add more pressure in the North, I think it's a really bad time for Russia overall. This gives me some leverage in negotiating with Russia.",True,True,-1
2519,1,1901,Winter,england,france,"I agree on our limited opportunities for direct collaboration next year. However, I'd like to hear what your builds are going to be. A fleet in Brest would make me worried about you and Germany collaborating on an invasion.",True,True,-1

2521,1,1901,Winter,england,france,Ok I think that's all of my messages for now.,True,True,-1
2522,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"It's possible, but I think Austria and Turkey are not friendly given the fact that Austria did not move Serbia to Rumania and Turkey tried to support that move. Russia is definitely still in trouble, though the target might be Turkey first.",True,True,1

2524,1,1901,Winter,france,england,Denmark is a guarantee if you can get a fleet into Skaggerak and have Russia support you in. It then becomes a 3V2,True,True,1

2529,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"Ok. I don't get why you think I'd build F Brest, but at the very least I appreciate the heads up. At some point I'd like to see you make a decisive move. So far it seems like you've been trying to make moves that both Germany and I agree to.",True,True,1
2530,1,1901,Winter,england,france,"You could break  DMZ in the channel and coordinate an invasion with Germany after building a fleet in Brest. By building in London I can do everything I might like to do eastward, and also i could respond better to a worst-case scenario.",True,True,-1

2532,1,1901,Winter,france,england,Sometimes the less options you have the better off you are. A lot of diplomacy is signalling.,True,True,1
2533,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"I mean, my thinking process last turn was wondering why you didn't go to Denmark. My conclusion was that Germany was probably supporting you to Belgium. I'm just telling you the vibes I'm getting from you",True,True,1

2535,1,1901,Winter,france,england,That's really interesting haha,True,True,1
2536,1,1901,Winter,england,france,Yeah so here I was thinking I had it in the bag. And then I first realized I flubbed my move and felt like an idiot. And then I looked closer and felt like an accidental genius.,True,True,-1
2537,1,1901,Winter,england,france,"So back to signaling. You backed out of your, admittedly, vague and implied agreement to support me. What signal does that send to me? Are you saying that you're coming for me? That I can't totally trust you?",True,True,-1

2539,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"So, I know this is a touchy subject, so I want to approach this delicately, but to be fair I was still deciding whether I would support you or not when you logged out for the night. I don't want to devolve this into ""what about when you did this thing that wasn't the best signal,"" but one of the things for me was considering why you weren't willing to move to Denmark. Sure, you want Belgium, but what does that mean for me when you want to put a fleet in Belgium and not an army? What is the follow-up play?",True,True,1
2540,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"I am not complaining about your duplicity. I'm complaining that we're missing opportunities to make strong progress because I think you aren't committed to working with me, but you aren't committed to working with Germany either. I think you would agree that had you worked with only Germany from the start, or worked with only me from the start, you'd be in a much better position, yeah?",NOANNOTATION,True,1
2541,1,1901,Winter,england,france,"Yeah, that's all fair. The timing thing makes remote play kind of weird when there's a lapse in communication before an important move. We didn't really have a chance to talk about the fleet vs army there.",True,True,-1
2542,1,1901,Winter,england,france,But I don't get why you don't think I've been working with you. You proposed two possibilities: Belgium or Holland/Denmark in 1902. I expressed my preference after raising some concerns about Germany's ability to counter Holland/Denmark. You agreed to help me to Belgium.,True,True,-1
2543,1,1901,Winter,england,france,"If you think commitment to a sole country is a good strategy, why haven't you followed it? Would you agree that I've been more committed to working with you than you have with me? That's pretty clear from your moves last turn.",True,True,-1
2544,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"All great points- and I agree with you on a lot of this. I was very willing to support you to Belgium, but I should have made it more clear that it needed to be an army. I do believe commitment is a good strategy, which is what led me to some admittedly anti-German opening moves. I'm not saying you have not shown commitment, after all we have an excellent DMZ in the channel, but it does bug me a bit that I cannot identify something you have done to antagonize Germany.",True,True,1
2545,1,1901,Winter,england,france,Well what would you like me to do to show this antagonism next year? Make the goal to secure denmark?,True,True,-1
2546,1,1901,Winter,france,england,Yes- I would very much love to see that. And the best part is that you get to see my super friendly builds before you decide on anything.,True,True,1
2547,1,1901,Winter,england,france,"Alright, this sounds good. Let's reconvene after builds then? That's Monday at noon right? It's probably time for me to get back to real life here haha.",True,True,-1
2548,1,1901,Winter,france,england,"Sounds great, me too haha.",True,True,1
2549,1,1902,Spring,france,england,Thoughts on builds?,True,True,1
2550,1,1902,Spring,england,france,"Yours were indeed friendly, which I appreciate. Germany's were what I expected. I thought Russia might have build in St. P, but I guess there's enough going on in the south to warrant the Warsaw build. The italian naples fleet is consistent with the lepanto, but then again what's the alternative build? Army in Rome? Also, I wonder if Austria-Italy are eyeing Munich this year.",NOANNOTATION,True,-1
2551,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"I have similar thoughts. I think that Russia and Turkey are both in a weak spot and all the evidence so far points towards them getting involved in a long and drawn out conflict. I'm sure Russia would have loved to build St Petersburg but couldn't afford to. Now, he is pretty much completely under your good graces. Austria and Italy may very well team up to take Munich.",True,True,1
2552,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"Germany's builds have come out to be very anti-French, so I am sure you are happy about those as well. It comes at the cost of cutting down the amount of options he has significantly. What do you think Germany might order?",True,True,1
2553,1,1902,Spring,england,france,"Trying to get a sense of the german plan now. I feel like germany has to play defense, unless they did something like Mun to Ruh to support into Bel or Bur to Gas to put pressure on Bre in the fall.",True,True,-1
2554,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"Yeah, I do to. I was thinking that my best play might be to ignore Burgundy and hope it holds and instead go for something annoying like Holland or Ruhr, which would leave him to either withdraw to defend or leave himself prone in the North. Of course, it could backfire if he's thinking the same thing and ends up in Gascony.",True,False,1
2555,1,1902,Spring,england,france,I'm trying to reason through how that plays out. Suppose germany supports Bur to Ruh with Bel. Then you can't penetrate right?,True,True,-1
2556,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"Yes, if he moves Bur to Ruhr with support I can't get in. But it would also mean he's out of Burgundy, which is good for me and means if I retake Burgundy that I can start applying pressure to Ruhr and Munich",True,True,1
2557,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"If he moves Kiel to ruhr, he leaves all sorts of things completely exposed like Denmark. And if he leaves Munich he leaves that open as well",True,True,1
2558,1,1902,Spring,england,france,"Yeah, germany is in a tough spot. Any word from Italy in all this? I'm guessing the lepanto is the focus, but a move to either Pie or Tyr would be kind of taking a side.",True,True,-1
2559,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"True. He said he was thinking about it, but not sure how much I can trust that. He'd certainly want to obscure moving to Piedmont if that is his plan.",True,True,1
2560,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"I know channel is tempting. If you think it might work, I'd totally support you to Holland, or I can tap Holland to make sure it can't leave by going to Helgoland without losing it. Moving to Helgoland or Skaggerak yourself can also be a strong play, especially if Germany thinks you are on his side. A move to skagg can be explained as a move on Russia and a move to Helgoland is deadly if it succeeds",True,True,1

2567,1,1902,Spring,england,france,I'd like one of Holland or Denmark this year. Both would be nice but maybe not feasible.,True,True,-1
2568,1,1902,Spring,england,france,Let's see Germany's Spring moves and restrategize.,True,True,-1
2569,1,1902,Spring,france,england,Sounds great!,True,True,1
2570,1,1902,Spring,france,england,I will go to Ruhr then to apply some pressure there. Hopefully I'll make the right guesses when it comes to what Germany will do with burgundy. I believe that we can get you Denmark or Holland but it may require some clever manuevering in the fall.,True,True,1
2571,1,1902,Spring,england,france,Are you self-bouncing in Gas to prevent the move there?,True,True,-1
2572,1,1902,Spring,france,england,That's a great option. I might change my moves to that actually. I have something more risky in mind at the moment though,True,True,1
2573,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"Nice, that worked out really well actually. Well done on taking the Helgoland Blight! That was a great call, and it means we can guarantee Holland for you next turn. Burgundy might retreat to Marseilles which is annoying, but manageable.  Or it could retreat to Munich. Very interesting that Russia made an aggressive move towards you.",True,True,1
2574,1,1902,Spring,england,france,"Nah, that was planned. Russia's trying to keep good graces with germany before helping me to denmark in the fall. I can't do this if I'm going for Holland though.",True,True,-1
2575,1,1902,Spring,england,france,I'm a little surprised austria and italy are totally staying out the fight. I guess they're really going for turkey.,True,True,-1
2576,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"Even better! If Russia is helping you with Denmark I can apply some pressure on Ruhr, and cracking that key position means that on the next turn we start threatening home centers like Kiel and will be in excellent shape to tackle Holland on the next year. Depends how much you trust Russia- seems like he's been radio silent for me, but then again we don't have a lot to talk about.",True,True,1
2577,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"Yeah the moves in the east are pretty crazy actually. They are going hard against Turkey, and Russia made some excellent moves it looks like so Turkey is in a very tough spot.",True,True,1
2578,1,1902,Spring,england,france,"Agreed we're in good shape. Though I imagine after these moves germany will make a hard play for russian support. If I can indeed trust russia, I'll convoy an army from Norway to Denmark and cut support from Kiel with HEL.",True,True,-1
2579,1,1902,Spring,england,france,I wonder if there's anything to offer Russia to sweeten the deal?,True,True,-1
2580,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"Great points. I think Russia may plan to further develop in the south, especially if he and Italy work something out against Austria, or if Austria and he work something out against Italy. If that's the case, he may just want the peace of mind that you are not going to attack him for a while. Otherwise, probably a German dot if he plans to play in the north.",True,True,1
2581,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"Looking back at the map, probably Berlin would be the best bet for a dot offer since Russia could take that with an army (after traveling to Prussia/Silesia from Warsaw) or with the fleet in Sweden (by traveling to the Baltic first).",True,True,1
2582,1,1902,Spring,england,france,Yeah that's what I was thinking. Russia seems fine to support without it.,True,True,-1
2583,1,1902,Spring,england,france,Poor germany. She said she's a first-timer.,True,True,-1
2584,1,1902,Spring,france,england,"Indeed. Though, I remember the people who I played with in my first few games were more than happy to introduce me to the game with some brutal stabs üòÇ",NOANNOTATION,True,1

2586,1,1902,Winter,france,england,Sorry for the late notice. Just a heads up that I plan to build a fleet in Brest but will park it in the MAO as a deterrent to Italy,False,True,1
2587,1,1903,Spring,england,france,Can you explain why you didn‚Äôt build it in Mar?,True,True,-1
2588,1,1903,Spring,france,england,"Yeah, sure. I couldn't build it in Marseilles because there would be very little I could tell Italy to persuade him that I wasn't planning to attack him with that build, even though that isn't my intention.",False,True,1
2589,1,1903,Spring,france,england,"What's the plan on the German front? Maybe we can get creative with the moves in a way that gets both of us at least one dot. I'm not holding myy breath on Ruhr, so I think the best play might be to send Belgium to Holland with support from the north sea while Denmark hits Kiel with support from Helgoland. If Germany makes similar moves to her last turn, we would pop both Kiel and Holland and would guarantee Munich/Berlin for next year. If Germany supports Kiel instead of moving to Ruhr, then we would guarantee Kiel in the fall as I'd walk into Ruhr and we would have Ruhr, Holland, Helgoland, and Denmark for a 4V3.",True,True,1

It's impossible to breach, I've checked it, and I can keep making those orders for years and years. You stabbed me in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. I think that you, Italy, and Germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Italy. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples.

4590,2,1902,Spring,russia,germany,Think you have to worry more about England right now. I‚Äôm going to be locked down in the south trying to deal with Turkey.

5242,2,1903,Fall,germany,turkey,That may be wishful thinking,NOANNOTATION,True,2

5252,2,1903,Fall,turkey,germany,"Also, England has never responded to me",True,True,-2
5253,2,1903,Fall,turkey,germany,I've also been amazed at how deaf italy has been to my chat about him having nothing to gain from austria winning basically all of turkey,True,True,-2
5254,2,1903,Fall,germany,turkey,"Yes, why is Italy so strongly joined at the hip with Austria? It seems unlikely that we will be able to pry him away unfortunately",True,True,2
5255,2,1903,Fall,turkey,germany,On multiple occasions has he been vaguely agreeable with my arguments to then try to stab me anyhow,NOANNOTATION,True,-2

5259,2,1903,Fall,turkey,germany,Italy supposedly is upset with austria. We'll see how it goes,True,True,-2
5260,2,1903,Winter,germany,turkey,Really? Why? Do you think it‚Äôs a ploy? If we can enlist Italy then there is no reason not to move on Austria immediately,True,True,3
5261,2,1903,Winter,turkey,germany,He's claimed to want to move against austria in various ways before to then try to stab me anyway. It had been only plays for me to lower my guard. I wouldn't trust him unless he makes the first move.,True,True,-3
5262,2,1903,Winter,germany,turkey,Agreed.,True,True,3
5263,2,1903,Winter,turkey,germany,"So this time I tried going into various strategies in why moving against Austria isn't as hard as he thinks it is. But he's acting not convinced.

5264,2,1903,Winter,germany,turkey,I agree. I would wait for some secondary evidence from england or me before trusting him to turn on Austria,False,True,3

5268,2,1904,Spring,turkey,germany,"Yes, that's true. However, if they play it right, as things stand, then there is no way for me to push forward without me losing something.

5269,2,1904,Spring,turkey,germany,Perhaps together with england I can hold the status quo but we'll see how that goes.,NOANNOTATION,True,-3
5270,2,1904,Fall,turkey,germany,Could you attack Ukr with War? I suspect it will support Sev so it can hold against my supported attack,True,True,-3

5273,2,1904,Fall,germany,turkey,England told me he was gonna support you into Sev,True,True,3
5274,2,1904,Fall,turkey,germany,I believe him but it's not enough if austria plays defensively and supports sev from Ukr and Rom,True,True,-3
5275,2,1904,Fall,turkey,germany,Then if I do go on the offensive it's very likely I lose something in my mainland.,True,True,-3
5276,2,1904,Fall,turkey,germany,So gambling on austria being greedy is the wrong move imo,True,True,-3
5277,2,1904,Fall,turkey,germany,Unless I can guarantee that I capture Sev.,True,True,-3
5278,2,1904,Fall,germany,turkey,Hmm. It‚Äôs your call. I would love to prevent Austria from getting another build,True,True,3
5279,2,1904,Fall,germany,turkey,Right. Is that possible?,True,True,3

5281,2,1904,Fall,germany,turkey,And do what?,NOANNOTATION,True,3
5282,2,1904,Fall,turkey,germany,"But, if you attack ukr with warsaw you'd also cut austria's support on a possible att on mosocow",True,True,-3
5283,2,1904,Fall,turkey,germany,So basically it's two birds with one stone.,True,True,-3
5284,2,1904,Fall,turkey,germany,I can get into Sev and you prevent a possible attack on moscow,True,True,-3
5285,2,1904,Fall,germany,turkey,"I made a commitment to england already, so you have to convince him.",True,True,3

England has been very very keen for me to take on Turkey. Which I'd like to, and may mean he'll be attacking Russia then, when he's sure Turkey will be distracted from sharing in the centers. So hopefully that's what he's up to, and not looking at our centers more locally.",True,True,0

6015,3,1904,Winter,germany,italy,I'm not sure about the France situation. I personally didn't talk to France at all this season. Maybe England still trusts France enough to leave him alone?,True,True,1

6017,3,1905,Winter,italy,germany,"My queen of the north... how committed are you to your attack on Austria at this point? As you probably noticed, Austria and I had just begun our attack on Turkey and now he is determined to double back and face you which I imagine means a new deal with Turkey and the reconstruction of AT block. 

Unless.

If you *are* committed to destroying him, maybe it's time we worked more directly together you and I?",False,True,-1

Let me know what you are thinking.",True,True,1
6019,3,1905,Winter,italy,germany,"That seems like our best channel to make some significant progress in the game at this point. As Italy I'm generally reluctant to fight Austria if it's avoidable, but I'm in the same position as you now. I can't go West (or I couldn't at that point and now all my units are in the wrong area) and I can't fight Turkey without support. 

Now appears to the the point where we can resolve our local situation nicely. Ideally I'd prefer to appear to be moving to stop you in the Spring and then declare my true allegiances in Fall if that works for you? Maybe I could move to Tyrolia ""to bounce you out"" only to end up there instead, giving me more angles against Trieste in the Fall? 

The more France manages to stall or tie up England the better for us at this point, I think? There will come a time when we need to fight him to get to our two-way, and if we can get a significant number advantage before England catches on then that's all to the better. 

I don't know; what do you think? 

Is it time for us to reach for that advantage?",True,True,-1

Classicly I suppose I should be focusing on a Lepanto approach, and I‚Äôm certainly uncomfortable with your fleets in Con and Smy. It‚Äôs also the bill of goods Russia‚Äôs been trying to sell Austria and I. 

On the other hand that depends on us being able to trust what Russia is up to and frankly I‚Äôm not certain of him at all. I was committed to supporting A Ser into Bul this year in exchange for his support into Greece... but if we go back to the order log we can both see that didn‚Äôt happen.

What do you have in mind? My immediate objectives are taking Tunis, keeping my coastal waters Italian and finding a friendship/alliance I can trust to take me to the late game, hopefully a 2-way draw.",True,True,0
6513,3,1902,Spring,turkey,italy,"Ah, what a relief to finally hear what sounds like honesty!

Those fleets were mainly meant to defend against a lepanto, and, fate willing, maybe seize the black sea that I naively ceded when I was young and trusting. Point is, they're not a threat to you especially since you're the only neighbor of mine willing to talk to me. They might even be useful for you in a few turns, if I'm still around.

I assume you want do dedicate your Nap fleet to snagging Tunis. And does the ""coastal waters"" thing mean you're concerned about the Adriatic? If not, then, what I hoped was that you might be willing to support Bul-Ser while stabbing Albania from the sea. This could set us up to start pushing back on Austria from the South.

6514,3,1902,Spring,italy,turkey,"I'd like that, and I agree it's a huge relief to cut through the nervous diplomatic double-speak! 

I think it's perfectly understandable for Turkey to want to defend against a Lepanto, especially when Italy is sounding cautious and doesn't really have many other options to expand. I've just built a second fleet, but then I think I need that to escape my boot whichever way I'm going. 

I am concerned about the Adriatic, but not sure I'm moving into it this year. I agree with your analysis of Bul (you're GOING to get hit) although it might be hard to bring up a new unit into Bul to replace your army there. Are you hoping to feed F Con to the east coast? You might need an Aegean fleet to force your way up, which should probably be yours unless  you're willing to extend me that much trust this early.

7041,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,We could take him out or let him keep Italy in check but then again we could use Italy's help against Turkey,True,True,-1
7042,3,1905,Spring,germany,england,"Yeah I'm not sure if it's better to cooperate with Italy and take out france, or just let the two of them fight it out a little longer.  I just wanted to check if you'd make any agreements recently to France",True,True,1
7043,3,1905,Spring,germany,england,I haven't talked to him in a season or two,True,True,1
7044,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,Just that I would ceasefire on our borders so he could focus on Italy,True,True,-1
7045,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,Nothing beyond that,True,True,-1
7046,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,I'm inclined to just cooperate with Italy and take him out. That would be one less loose end. If we do that then we would have Italy's and Austria's help to eliminate Turkey,True,True,-1
7047,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,Also in about one more year it will be time to start insinuating to Italy and Austria  that we will betray each other after turkey is gone,True,True,-1

7054,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,I wouldn't mind sharing France with you though,True,True,-1
7055,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,Besides I have 2 armies that I need to put to use in the east. I could get the far eastern fringe of Russia and you would be getting most of Austria.,True,True,-1
7056,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,Ooo I don't want to count the chicks before they hatch but imaging an English turkey?!!! Austria for you Turkey for me and we share the Balkans or something along those lines,True,True,-1
7057,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,"About support to bur, let me see first if France will reply and accept my offer to help him regain marseilles",True,True,-1
7058,3,1905,Spring,germany,england,Ok that seems fair. I know we had talked about you just having StP when we originally discussed Russia. The only problem is that Austria is really worried about you at the moment and doesn't want to cooperate or make moves against Turkey when he sees you rolling down russia.,True,True,1
7059,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,Italy is spooking everybody about me :/,True,True,-1
7060,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,So what does Austria want me to do then? Stab you instead of going south to help against Turkey?,True,True,-1

7064,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,I could understand such a feeling which is why I'm trying to keep as far away from your borders as possible while simultaneously keeping up with your growth.,True,True,-1
7065,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,"""Half of the Kingdom"" seems to be coming to fruition sooner than expected hahaha",True,True,-1
7066,3,1905,Spring,germany,england,"Hah yes, I understand too. I suppose I'm feeling a bit undecided on how to deal with Austria at the moment.",True,True,1
7067,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,Tell you what. You take Moscow then and  I'll stay in the background like a lion ready to pounce at the right time. You get your leverage on Austria with that and in return you help me get Paris and bre.,True,True,-1
7068,3,1905,Spring,germany,england,"I'm moving into Pru to insinuate to Austria that I'll be trying to move into StP, and hopefully that will be enough to keep him off my back another season or two",True,True,1

7070,3,1905,Spring,england,germany,Or I go to moscow this spring and you ask him to move to ukr to support you into Moscow in the fall.,True,True,-1

7072,3,1905,Spring,germany,england,"Hmm both good ideas. Though it seems unlikely that you wouldn't bounce in Moscow without my support, and if I support you, then the whole rue with Austria is up",True,True,1

That being said, I think we still have a lot to gain by working together. As we stand, we are certainly stronger than any other pair of nations, and we probably have fighting chances against the rest of the board even if they all united against us.

You have a best probabilistic set of moves, but the best you can realistically hope for is maybe 1 build if you go +Greece, +Serbia, -Trieste.  Maybe.

Normally when playing Russia I try to grab a couple German centers around 1904, allowing me to hold over the stalemate line setting up a solo when I conquer the East.

I've kind of retreated into a posture that's more defensive than it probably should be, but if you and England are going to present a United front I really can't do anything else, except to hope that A) you reconsider your alliances or B) England decides to stab you (my least preferred option)",True,True,2

Because I must move all units Northward to defend against E/G, I'm absolutely forced to leave my Southern border undefended. If Turkey grows to 12 or 13 centers they could easily roll up my Southern Centers and solo this whole thing.

I hope I'm not coming off as beating a dead horse here, but it makes so much sense for us to be aligned. 

1) A G/R/T Alliance can be easily balanced until 1910. 
2) I am already positioned to help you against England.

What I can do is work to make England see that if France can't be trusted, trying to force his way in through StP is a death sentence: growth will be too slow, France will have to circle back for him, and his forces will be committed to that logjam in the Northeast.

I should be able to convince him to convoy to Belgium, and that's his only army.  Should give you plenty of breathing room.  I'll try to convince him to focus on France.  Self-serving, but probably in his best interests anyway.

Since clearly France can't be trusted, and obviously he'll have to come for you at some point to go for the win, maybe a convoy to Belgium is in order?  You can hold StP easily, get 2 builds, prevent France from getting any, and change the balance of power pretty dramatically.

If you really trust France you could also convoy to Holland and take a stab at crippling me permanently - he'll get +1 or +2, you'll get +2.  Though you risk bouncing with France if he gets greedy.  But if he builds, and you see a F Mar, you're in for a rough go.  If it's me, convoy to Belgium is the smarter play.  I don't even see it as a stab on your end - our alliance was three-way, and it is broken.  If you weren't in on it, it's broken for all of us.",NOANNOTATION,True,-1
8314,6,1904,Fall,germany,russia,"(pt 2:)
In either case, it's probably not a great idea to try to force your way into Russia via StP.  You've got it, and can hold it easily - there's a reason it's part of the stalemate lines.  You need to grow as fast as you can, or you're just waiting for a knife.  I was waiting for Turkey to stab Russia to give you an opening.  It didn't come, so I tried to force it and opened myself.  But if Turkey stabs now he'll collapse too quickly for you to get (or at least get with any chance to defend) more than one more center.

I would strongly consider figuring out lines and conditions with Russia so you can both dedicate your forces elsewhere.  And I say that knowing that a highly likely place for Russia to dedicate forces is at me.  But since the second most likely (and possibly first) is at Turkey, which takes a partner from France, it's worth the risk.

I wanted to reach out to you to see where your mind is at initially.  I also wanted to let you know up front that, unless something changes, I will be moving to Ruhr.  I'm not worrying about Belgium at this point, but I do want to ensure that I have Holland locked down.  Most importantly, this isn't intended as hostility towards you.

Bounce in Burgundy sounds good. But your move to Ruh... idk, not really liking that. Holland is guaranteed to you winter 1901 no matter if you have Ruh or not. The main reason you would move it there in 1901 would be to take Belgium, and then move in on me. It feels pretty anti-france.

I'm not a big fan of a bounce in Burgundy.  It's kind of a fear maneuver that puts both of us behind overall.  It's nice on your end, since it functions as your defense and frees up Marsailles.

I'm moving to Ruhr, which isn't considered to be anti-France generally.  Holland isn't garaunteed to me unless I pass on Denmark.  Moving to the Ruhr (or successfully to Burgundy, which I assume you wouldn't like) is the only way to ensure Holland without F-Kie-Hol.  If you're moving to Burgundy that will pretty much cast the die, I guess.

But things change.  Looking around, Russia - with whom I have a NAP expiring in the fall - is about to crush Austria and Turkey at once, which will makd him essentially unstoppable.  Based on the build in the Irish Sea, England is certainly not preparing to box him in up North, never mind pressure him.  He may be working with him.  As far as I can tell, Italy isn't talking to anyone, but jumped on Austria as well.  I need Austria to provide some resistance at the very least, and so do you.

You're right, of course.  That is the one scenario that's a problem.  It's just that I think it's the least likely - far less likely than Boh providing the support for an attack.  That's because we don't have a unit adjacent to Bohemia, so we can't break the support.

I've been thinking about this game alot, because the fact that it will only last until 1910 really changes my strategy. Add in that no one is likely to NMR and I believe it will be near impossible to solo. As such, it really only makes sense to find a ride or die partner for close tactical coordination and grab as many centers as possible.

As I'm sure you know, when R/T can trust each other and are firing on all 8 the Juggernaut can be nearly unstoppable. You, as Turkey, are my number 1 preferred partner in this game. I propose that we ally to dominate the Eastern sphere of this game. Do you agree?",True,True,1

I've been toying with the idea of asking for an Alliance of you, Germany and I to go to 1910 together. I think it's the only thing that makes strategic sense.

In any event, yes, I expect Italy to drop two fleets and position on me.

I think there are other options as well, like if I supported Austria from Serbia to Trieste, allowing you to move into Serbia, keeping Austria at 3 centers and harming Italy. That kind of move has a much greater risk of blowing up in our faces, however.

I've also heard stuff from Austria about you that is concerning, so it's not just England pulling a fast one on me.

9115,7,1902,Fall,russia,germany,"Austria has asked me to move my units towards you (away from him, I suppose).  How did your discussions with Italy go regarding his unit in Tyrolia?  He seems to have fled south quickly (most likely to convoy over to Syria).",True,True,1
9116,7,1902,Fall,germany,russia,"Actually I didn't even talk to him last phase, and the phase before I just said that attacking Austria was dumb unless he was in a wintergreen alliance.",True,True,-1
9117,7,1902,Fall,russia,germany,"well, that was apparently the way to get him to go south.",True,True,1

9126,7,1902,Fall,germany,russia,I mean,True,True,-1
9127,7,1902,Fall,germany,russia,Is there any way of me getting your help this phase?,True,True,-1
9128,7,1902,Fall,russia,germany,I'm not actually in any of your centers.,True,True,1
9129,7,1902,Fall,germany,russia,But you supported England into my SC after I supported you,True,True,-1
9130,7,1902,Fall,russia,germany,what do you want?  would you prefer to focus on england?,True,True,1
9131,7,1902,Fall,germany,russia,"I thought I made myself clear that England was my whole focus last phase. Now that you've allied with England against me, I have two people to be mad at now. You attacking me is more understandable than England though",True,True,-1
9132,7,1902,Fall,germany,russia,Oh... except you are in Bohemia and Silesia,True,True,-1
9133,7,1902,Fall,russia,germany,"well, he agreed to dmz the north, as i explained, and then he made the moves to support it.",True,True,1

9135,7,1902,Fall,russia,germany,"Look, it doesn't do me great good to knock you out of the game right away.  I was wondering if you'd be open to a dialogue or are you closed off to any kind of dicussions.",True,True,1
9136,7,1902,Fall,germany,russia,"I mean I'm open to discussion, but I'm using most of my efforts with other countries since I feel like I wont be able to get very far this phase with you. In later phases things will change though",True,True,-1

9138,7,1903,Spring,russia,germany,How would you suggest going about helping me against Austria?,True,True,3

9141,7,1903,Winter,russia,germany,Thought England was interested in working with me against you.  I have no idea why he went for Sweden instead of taking a (guaranteed) support into Kiel.  Sorry.,True,True,2
9142,7,1903,Winter,germany,russia,You're apologizing to me for England not attacking me?,True,True,-2
9143,7,1903,Winter,russia,germany,Sure,True,True,2
9144,7,1903,Winter,russia,germany,I‚Äôm apologizing for trusting him.,True,True,2
9145,7,1904,Spring,russia,germany,Would you like support into Denmark?,True,True,2
9146,7,1904,Spring,germany,russia,If I order Kiel to Denmark you could take Berlin by force. Once you've backed off my border I'll consider moving my troops in a way other than protecting myself against invaders.,True,True,-2
9147,7,1904,Spring,russia,germany,That‚Äôs totally fair. I‚Äôll make that a possibility.,False,True,2
9148,7,1906,Winter,russia,germany,what do you want me to build?,True,True,-3
9149,7,1906,Winter,germany,russia,An army would be preferable,True,True,3
9150,7,1906,Winter,russia,germany,done.  can we go our separate ways?,True,True,-3
9151,7,1906,Winter,germany,russia,"Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what Austria and Italy are doing now",True,True,3
9152,7,1906,Winter,russia,germany,"well, Italy is about to get desparate for dots.  So, I'd watch your back.",True,True,-3
9153,7,1907,Spring,russia,germany,I build the army and would like to head south.  I'd appreciate it if you held off from attacking STP or headed towards Warsaw.  i honestly believe that you have bigger fish to fry and can makes some great headway with your fleets if you head west.,True,True,-3
9154,7,1907,Fall,russia,germany,Why are you sending your fleet at me?,True,True,-3
9155,7,1907,Fall,germany,russia,"Please, if I wanted to attack you I'd go from Norway. Baltic was going to cover Berlin, but now it will bounce in Denmark",True,True,3
9156,7,1907,Winter,russia,germany,"classical mid-game mistake, going after Russia instead of Austria.",True,True,-4
9157,7,1907,Winter,russia,germany,"the problem with weakening Russia at this point - is by the time you shift towards Austria, there's no  way to beat him off - and you can't hold Warsaw and Moscow against him.",True,True,-4
9158,7,1907,Winter,germany,russia,He only has 4 SCs,True,True,4
9159,7,1907,Winter,russia,germany,"Well, who do you think will get Italy‚Äôs",True,True,-4
9160,7,1907,Winter,germany,russia,France?,True,True,4

9162,7,1907,Winter,russia,germany,Those two have been cuddle buddies from the jump,NOANNOTATION,True,-4
9163,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,Hello germany! I figured we should open up talks,True,True,0
9164,7,1901,Spring,germany,england,"Yes, most certainly. I would very much like to work with you against Russia to keep him from dominating the North, and working against France together would also be great. E/G is one of my favorite alliances to play.",True,True,0
9165,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,Would you be okay with the idea of me having Hol? The fifth build can be tough for England.,True,True,0
9166,7,1901,Spring,germany,england,"I would very much not be okay with you having Hol, it's an SC directly bordering my home. I can help you into Bel though, or help you against Russia into Sweden or St Pete for that extra SC or 2.",True,True,0
9167,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,Understandable but worth the ask in my opinion. Not trying to be overly aggressive.,True,True,0
9168,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,"I don‚Äôt want to overcommit to attacking anyone this early, but I appreciate you offering support. So you don‚Äôt think you and France will be friendly?",True,False,0
9169,7,1901,Spring,germany,england,As a western power I usually stay undecided as to who I really want to work with during the first year. But generally speaking I prefer an E/G over an F/G or E/F. It just makes dealing with Russia so much easier.,True,True,0
9170,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,"Makes sense I play germany the same way, any time that I am too aggressive or get 6 in the first year I end up getting ganged up on.",True,True,0
9171,7,1901,Spring,germany,england,So Russia sent me a message asking for a deal. He said if I would help him into Sweden he would support me into North Sea after he takes Norway. This obviously raises some red flags since he is already assuming he will take Norway. I'd be surprised if he wasn't opening Moscow to St Pete.,True,True,0
9172,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,"He told me he wants to open against Germany, and that he would help me into Denmark from Sweden üòÇ I didn‚Äôt believe him (and voted so) because that is a terrible opening for Russia. Seems like he is a troublemaker",True,True,0
9173,7,1901,Spring,germany,england,"Lol. Yeah, he's the only person I've thumbs downed so far.",True,True,0
9174,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,So he told austria to his face that he plans on moving into Gal (according to Austria) seems like a wildcard,True,True,0
9175,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,Have you actually talked to France yet,True,True,0
9176,7,1901,Spring,germany,england,I sent a message. He just responded. Reading it next.,True,True,0
9177,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,How‚Äôd that go?,True,True,0
9178,7,1901,Spring,germany,england,"Well, he told me he was supporting himself into Burgundy, so uhhhh.... not really liking him so far",True,True,0
9179,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,"Oof, yeah that is aggressive. At least he‚Äôs honest?",True,True,0
9180,7,1901,Spring,germany,england,"He could be bluffing. Get me to think that moving to Bur is pointless and that I should stay in Munich. Instead he blitzes north to Pic and takes Bur from Marseilles uncontested. Now he has two units poised to take Bel or possibly attack Munich if I do leave. Either way, telling me that is not good news for me",True,True,0
9181,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,Yeah it means he will not be friendly. I‚Äôll be in NTH so I‚Äôll be in a powerful position. I‚Äôll be happy to lend support assuming I am cleared to get Nwy. Just let me know,True,False,0
9182,7,1901,Spring,germany,england,"Yeah I think we'll be fine, it's just hard that France and Russia are both playing against us.",True,True,0
9183,7,1901,Spring,england,germany,"We will see what russia actually does, they seem like a wildcard",True,True,0
9184,7,1901,Fall,germany,england,"Well, you are poised to take Norway, and I can bounce Russia out of Sweden. I'd like to take Holland, but you can have Belgium. Unfortunately France did get into Burgundy like he said, so he could either go to Munich or Belgium.",True,True,0
9185,7,1901,Fall,england,germany,Yeah I am trying to find out for you (discretely) if he will be hitting Munich. Are you actually planning on bouncing Swe? I think it‚Äôs a fun move. How do you want to handle the French threat? I might be able to bounce him  in Bel or even take it if he goes Mun like I would expect,True,False,0
9186,7,1901,Fall,germany,england,"In full disclosure, France offered to go to EC and I said I'd love that, fully expecting him to never go there (why would he give up a build to go EC?). France told me that you were lobbying for him to go to Ruhr, which doesn't exactly match up with the last message you just sent me.",True,True,0
9187,7,1901,Fall,germany,england,"If France doesn't go to Bel, Spain, and Portugal I would be very surprised. I'm going to cover Munich regardless, it's too big of a risk to let him in.",True,True,0
9188,7,1901,Fall,england,germany,"That makes sense, that‚Äôs annoying that France is trying to split us up. At least I can bounce him in Bel. Are you doing the russia bounce? If I am going to stand with you I need to know if I have to prepare for some Russian anger",True,True,0
9189,7,1901,Fall,germany,england,Yeah I lied to Russia.,True,True,0
9190,7,1901,Fall,england,germany,"üòÇüòÇ sounds good, so how do you want me to play this turn? Hit bel?",NOANNOTATION,True,0
9191,7,1901,Fall,germany,england,You never denied that you told France to go to Ruhr.,True,True,0
9192,7,1901,Fall,germany,england,I'm too paranoid for this game,True,True,0
9193,7,1901,Fall,germany,england,I would love it if you went to Bel,True,True,0
9194,7,1901,Fall,england,germany,"I did not tell France to go Ruh, I don‚Äôt want that much pressure on you and it would be better for us if he went Bel and I bounced him",True,False,0
9195,7,1901,Winter,germany,england,"Well that was kinda dumb on your part. You knew I was going to Holland, so you didn't get a build AND you made me mad. I was soooooo sold on allying with you all game, but not anymore. Can you please explain your thought process there?",True,True,0
9196,7,1902,Spring,england,germany,"Not sure what I need to explain, I feel like I have more to gain siding with France, especially since you have angered Russia.",True,True,0
9197,7,1902,Spring,germany,england,Except that France is now at 6 SCs and you are at 4 and I'm much more angry at you. France is in a much better position than you now.,True,True,0
9198,7,1902,Fall,germany,england,I still dont understand why you are gunning for me. I literally was ready to work with you wholeheartedly and you are attacking me while leaving yourself open to Russia and France who are not exactly helping you back. I guess their lies are more persuasive than my truth...,True,True,0
9199,7,1902,Fall,england,germany,I stabbed you but now it looks like France is stabbing me. I‚Äôm going to stop attacking you after I take Den,True,True,0
9200,7,1902,Fall,germany,england,"Lol. Or you could not take Denmark, protect yourself, and try to stop France.",True,True,0
9201,7,1903,Spring,germany,england,So if you stop attacking me I will shift all aggression to Russia.,NOANNOTATION,True,-1
9202,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,If you want to help stop Russia from rolling me (then possibly teaming up with France against you) I would appreciate Denmark tapping Baltic.,True,True,-1
9203,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,I‚Äôd consider it if you could get France off my back,True,True,1
9204,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,"I tried working with you against France at the beginning and you declined. Now it's a bit late, as I warned you before. I can try to get him to back off, but it will be very difficult at this point.",True,True,-1
9205,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,"Yeah I‚Äôm not saying that we have a full alliance but there‚Äôs no reason for me to just help you, especially when it would leave me with 0 allies",True,True,1
9206,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,"Do you have more than 0 allies right now? I wouldn't consider Russia an ally so much as he isn't going to attack you until I'm dead. Russia has turned on Turkey when convenient, turned on Austria when convenient, and Italy thought they were allies when they weren't. Trusting Russia will kill you.",True,True,-1
9207,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,"Okay so several countries have come to me saying that you are painting me as not wanting to work with you. That's entirely false. I have made 0 moves against you. You have attacked me. I have asked for your help against Russia, you said you would only do it if I somehow got France to help.
From my point of view I have done everything in my power to work with you, and you are spurning me at any chance you get.
Please stop working against me. Please stop spreading false ideas about me. Is there something I did to personally offend you?",True,True,-1
9208,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,"I am not trying to spread lies, I genuinely feel as though you have no interest in working with me. I was under the impression that you said that it was ‚Äútoo late‚Äù for us to work together. England/Germany/France is always a 2 on 1, usually with England choosing their side. I played both and decided to go with France mainly because their plan and communication felt better. I chose wrong, and I am paying dearly for it. I apologize for doing so. At this point it feels as though you are working with France, which is inherently against me. If I have read that wrong then I apologize, but for those reasons I could not just go against Russia because in doing so I would cause a 3 on 1. That is why I asked you to get France off of me in exchange, it is the only way I survive. Otherwise it doesn‚Äôt make a difference to me if I lose and France wins or I lose and Russia wins.",True,True,1
9209,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,"I am honestly sorry for how our game has started, and I am proposing an alliance between the two of us. I know that it will be hard for you to trust me, but I think that you can see that it is my only option, and so to betray you again would be short sighted and suicidal. If you can‚Äôt trust me, then I have no choice but to hope russia wants me as his sidekick given my navel power. I don‚Äôt want that to be my role in this game, so I hope that you will consider my proposal.",True,True,1
9210,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,"Thank you for being honest with me now. I'm not working against you at all. I am very interested in working with you, considering that I was the one who approached you and asked to work against Russia together. 
I actually felt like you didn't want to work with me, because you were saying you wouldn't work with me unless France backed off - something I cant control.",True,True,-1
9211,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,"I have been talking with France, and I think i might have actually got him properly scared of Russia to back off of you. I'm waiting to hear back from my latest message, but he will only do it if you actually do help against Russia, something I still dont know if i can trust you on.",True,False,-1
9212,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,"So how do we do this. I can help you by stopping russia in the north, you can help me by putting some pressure on France so that he has to go home. What do you think about me supporting you into the Bal from Kiel and supporting you into Bel. You push back russia a little, and cost France a build if you cut the Bur support.",True,True,1
9213,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,Oh so you don‚Äôt want to go against France?,True,True,1
9214,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,"I cant attack France with Munich this turn. I will likely lose Munich if I attack Bur, and then that does me no good at all, since I'll be at like 1 SC at the end of the year.",True,True,-1
9215,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,"That‚Äôs fair, how about that Kiel move then",True,True,1
9216,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,"If Russia moves Baltic into Berlin with support than I have lost Berlin, vacated Kiel, and again I'm down to like 2 SCs. I really do want to work with you, but you and Russia put me in a super super bad position and I pretty much have to hold this phase. I have tried to think of ways around it and I just cant.",True,True,-1
9217,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,Holland is free though,True,True,-1
9218,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,I suppose if I trusted you and France 100% I could use Holland to cover for Kiel,True,True,-1
9219,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,I am sending NTH to Lon this year (I hope it works) which would make you feel better. If you want this to work you will have to trust me.,True,True,1
9220,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,"Honestly I think the best help might just be tapping Baltic for me so that I can hold everything tight this phase, but that's just going to stall everything out, so idk. This game is pretty hopeless for me I'm afraid.",True,True,-1
9221,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,"Me as well, I messed up things for both of us and I apologize. Why don‚Äôt I just gamble and take Sweden?",True,True,1
9222,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,"Well, BOT is probably going to Sweden, so that also wouldn't be a terrible move",True,True,-1
9223,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,"BOT might fill Bal, he thinks I‚Äôm getting him into Ber this turn",True,True,1
9224,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,Where are you supposed to be supporting him from?,True,True,-1
9225,7,1903,Fall,germany,england,Oh... Bal,True,True,-1
9226,7,1903,Fall,england,germany,"Yep, obviously I will not though",True,True,1

9230,7,1903,Winter,germany,england,"Well, Russia has a disband and we both kept our SCs this year, so that's good news. France unfortunately still seems intent on attacking you, he never responded to my last message",True,True,-1

Let's be honest with ourselves, if both Italy AND Turkey want to attack Austria, Russia is pretty much always going to join in.  Maybe Turkey is lying to me and is going to work with you to force Rumania or something.  I doubt it though.  I wish you the best of luck and i'm sorry if things turn out super bad for you.

I‚Äôd ask you to consider this - you can gain two neutrals and lose one of your home centers for a net of four. Or, you can protect your home centers, gain, one, and get position on the guy who attacked you ... and earn an ally. I think that‚Äôs a very fair prospect.",False,True,0

However, even with this, you're still a threat to solo.  I would need to get Munich or STP, otherwise you've got a path to a solo.   So yeah, we need to balance of power this.

If you build an army in smyrna (on the pretense of convoying it somewhere) then you can walk into sevastopol next year. As an initial stab you will almost certainly be able to take Vienna with bohemia and trieste, followed by budapest with help from albania having moved to serbia. That‚Äôs russia down to two dots and you up to 11 with nary a cession from me. Meanwhile germany would be fending me off, so you‚Äôd not have to worry about german attacks on old-austria.

EDI, HOL, and - with the fleets you have available - DEN, SWE, NOR, and STP.   That's assuming no gains in mainland germany.  So, this means that Germany and Russia are going to need to work together in the north to stop you - which I'm willing to allow, unless you let me take the Italian dots.

...how about this: we illustrate our commitment this spring by each overtly stabbing our allies and making no moves against each other or into the ionian. Then in fall I‚Äôll let you into venice and start moseying out of italy, and shift my focus northward.

I guess you can call that gaslighting.  I call it applying years of experience and calling a spade a spade.

Moving on, which is all I've been trying to do, you need - at most - one more fleet in the south beyond your MAR, TYS, and TUN - which I assume will be your Fleet in LVP headed south.  That leaves your remaining seven units (didn't include the A PIE)  to hold Russia in check and take Scandinavia.

You may have a different opinion, but I don‚Äôt see you as being in the same boat. Even if you vacate Tri and I take it (which I won‚Äôt) you would still get a build and I would end up being stuck fighting you without much momentum.

10803,9,1902,Spring,italy,austria,"Russia is planning on supporting Germany against France and England, if you did so as well that would slow them down. You could use your two Balkan units to help us against Turkey. We could get you Bul and help you keep it. I have some ideas for move combinations if you agree",True,True,-1
10804,9,1902,Spring,italy,austria,What makes you worried about France?,True,True,-1
10805,9,1902,Spring,austria,italy,"well.. neither France nor England went into the English Channel.  That leads me to believe they are working together.  So, if that is correct there are only 2 directions for france to go.  through germany  or south through you.",True,True,1

10813,9,1902,Fall,austria,italy,to the detriment of turkey... they didn't want to listen and they put themselves in such a bad space.  I think the person playing Turkey does not understand this game.  I gave them a solid plan and instead they gave up the black sea... o well.,True,True,1
10814,9,1902,Fall,italy,austria,How do you want to handle the situation?,True,True,-1
10815,9,1902,Fall,austria,italy,im not sure.  meanwhile I warned you about France and he has moved his fleet into Gold of Lyo... what do you think he is doing with that fleet? it cant be to help you.,True,True,1

10825,9,1901,Spring,russia,italy,I fully agree. Russia's well served by a friend in Italy as well. I'm primarily concerned with which proverbial horse I'm going to back in the inevitable Austria vs. Turkey rumble. What do you think?,True,True,1
10826,9,1901,Spring,italy,russia,I‚Äôd personally favor Austria.,True,True,-1

10831,9,1901,Spring,italy,russia,Have you talked to Turkey yet?,True,True,-1
10832,9,1901,Spring,russia,italy,"I have yes, we've essentially agreed to bounce in the black sea and we've talked about fighting the Austrians. Still no word from the Austrians on my end about possibly fighting the Turks.",True,True,1

10905,9,1902,Spring,russia,italy,France made some interesting choices with that build. Normally building fleets in the north would be something that puts the British deeply on edge.,True,True,2

10920,9,1902,Spring,russia,italy,They started playing their cards very close to their chest with me though so I don't know if they trust me anymore. If you can get them off guard as far as your skill goes I can definitely see that going to your advantage.,True,True,2

10928,9,1902,Spring,russia,italy,"There's not much I can do about France without dealing with the British first, but the best thing that we could do for the time being is see to it that the Turks are eliminated.

On that note, I'm working a deep subterfuge with the Turks.

10934,9,1902,Spring,russia,italy,"Yeah, it messes up from time to time. The French have assured me emphatically that they never had any plans to attack you to begin with, and have indicated a temptation to make a rush at Liverpool if I advance the front in Scandinavia.",True,True,2

11018,9,1902,Fall,russia,italy,There's too many risks if you ask me. If the Austrians supported from Greece to Bulgaria we'd get Greece but the Turks would lose Bulgaria and we'd have a shit time. I don't think he'll try to support Greece holding.,True,True,2

Unfortunately as well, the Turks are rearing to get at you too; I'll convince them otherwise, and if we make sufficient progress (Unfortunately the only way I envision it working is if the Turks get Serbia for now, similar with how the Austrians would have gotten Bulgaria) I will be in Budapest, and if things go *really* well, I'll stab the Turks before year's end to keep their minds off of you. If the French back off we can easily get you Trieste and then start making serious gains on your front.

But anyways, the survival of your fleet in Belgium, at this point, depends on you either convincing the French not to block you out of either the English Channel or Piedmont, OR, using the fleet in Kiel to support an attack against the army in the Netherlands; the first isn't ideal because it's relying on the French, but the second isn't ideal because it's keeping Kiel stationary and thus blocking the exit of the Danish army, which is practically dead-weight where it is since it can't support to any of the sea-zones around it. 

I'd move Munich to Ruhr and Berlin to Munich. Additionally, I would do the second option with your fleets whether or not you get an agreement from the French. It leaves you in a much better strategic position even though it effectively ensures the loss of Belgium.",True,True,1

11454,9,1902,Fall,russia,germany,"France is definitely coming for you, but how's this for a tricksy little solution to the issue: 

Currently you are at serious risk of losing Belgium; that sucks, but if you move yourself to Holland you can avoid the destruction of that fleet. Even better though, if you make another move toward the North Sea, I can now *support* that move with Norway, meaning that unless the British successfully predict that, you are in position to take Edinburgh and threaten London unless they pull fleets back; if they pull fleets back, it takes pressure off of me and allows me to forward-deploy my own fleets, which are currently pinned down by British blockade.

Furthermore, you can move your fleet from the Helgoland Bight into Holland to take it, and use Kiel to support Munich to ensure Munich holds for long enough that the British have to disband. There are risks involved in the maneuver of course. The British could not only move themselves to Belgium, but they could move their fleet from the North Sea into Holland, bouncing you out and keeping all of their forces intact despite the loss of the North Sea.",True,True,1
11455,9,1902,Fall,germany,russia,Word I actually love that strategy.,True,True,-1

11457,9,1902,Fall,russia,germany,"So I'll be supporting from Belgium to the North Sea then? There's a further significant risk that the British will use one of their fleets in the north to defeat Norway's support and thus keep the North Sea AND Netherlands AND take Belgium.

Personally, I actually am not a fan of the move. Too many risks to be realistically successful this turn, better saved until next year I think. You're better off using the Helgoland Bight to support Belgium in a retreat to Holland for the time being, and then perform this maneuver next year when your position is more solid and the British have lost a unit. If Munich weren't under enough risk that you could use Kiel to support into Holland as well it would be much more viable.

Sorry to be doing all these thought problems in full view, I'm just trying to work out how best to break Britain and get ourselves on the offensive. This turn ain't it though I think.",True,True,1

The risk of an early conflict between France and Germany is pretty high, so suggest that we clear the air early on.

The biggest question here is Burgundy, which borders one of your home supply centers and two of mine. It is important to me that Burgundy remains unoccupied - my suggestion is that we set up a bounce between A Munich - Burgundy, A Paris - Burgundy. This has the secondary benefit of allowing us to put on some theater about how the other broke their word to win sympathy points. I also believe that Germany often wants A Munich to stay put anyways, to guard against an attack through Tyrolia.

Let me also know your thoughts regarding Belgium. I am not super attached to claiming it, so would be open to bargain my support on the Belgian question for a future alliance.

11826,9,1902,Fall,russia,england,This turn's going to be quite a weird one isn't it?,True,True,1
11827,9,1902,Fall,england,russia,I suppose. Any way I can persuade you to give me my supply center back?,True,True,-1
11828,9,1902,Fall,russia,england,"Considering you tried to land an army, clearly aiming to overpower first St. Petersburg and then Sweden and so on and so forth, I would rather not if I'm honest. It pains me to see that I guessed correctly that you'd try to launch an offensive, but I'm not fool enough to step aside and let it happen now that I know. No offense.

You could likely walk into Belgium though, considering the Germans and French have talked (Partly through me, which was weird tbh) and agreed that the Germans will walk out, and the French will occupy it with a single unit; you could overpower that easily. I doubt that's part of your plan though all things considered.",True,True,1
11829,9,1902,Fall,england,russia,"You sure? France said they were going to support themselves in and, so far they have been 100% honest with me.

Frankly, I would rather you have it then them. This would be, of course, provided you give me Norway back.",True,False,-1
11830,9,1902,Fall,russia,england,"I'm just telling you what they told me dawg.

And I'm afraid that for defensive purposes, relinquishing Norway at this point isn't really an option. I can assist you in taking Denmark, and possibly Kiel so long as I get Berlin, but Norway is too vital. I'd need you to get out of the Barents first of course.",True,True,1

11834,9,1902,Fall,russia,england,"I'd prefer to take that army elsewhere. Neither of us gains much of anything by being enemies but the more time passes with your fleets so far away from Liverpool, the more the French might see you as an easy target. If you have to deconstruct two units this turn you'd have a hard time stopping them too. That's just my personal take though.",True,True,1

I admit that that would be a good outcome, but just speaking honestly and frankly, you have no chance of stopping a French solo if all goes wrong for you this turn, how long will it take before they see you as liability that they can't afford?

11972,9,1902,Fall,russia,turkey,"Of course, the intelligence we get defines our strategy. I just hope that the Austrians didn't go AFK for the rest of the night until the orders hit like they normally do.",True,True,2
11973,9,1902,Fall,turkey,russia,"Speaking of going afk, I have to go take a final exam now, but I'm pretty sure my orders are set anyways ?",True,True,-2
11974,9,1902,Fall,russia,turkey,"Unless the Italians deliver something earth shattering, I think so yes. Good luck on your test!",True,True,2
11975,9,1902,Fall,turkey,russia,Thanks :p,True,True,-2
11976,9,1902,Winter,russia,turkey,Are you alright if I build an army in Sevastopol?,True,True,3
11977,9,1902,Winter,turkey,russia,"I'd rather see it in Moscow to be honest, but if you feel like it's necessary I won't object too much",True,True,-3
11978,9,1902,Winter,russia,turkey,"I just want to keep the Austrians guessing about what I intend to do with that. Plus, I already convinced them again that I'm on their side despite having supported you for two turns now, so it might be important to speed things up to keep up the pretense that I might think about going toward you. Keep them confused, y'know?",True,True,3
11979,9,1902,Winter,turkey,russia,"Alright, that's fair, just as long as they're the one getting tricked :p",True,True,-3
11980,9,1902,Winter,russia,turkey,"Think the Italians and I are supporting you into Serbia first turn, and then me to Budapest the second, that scan as far as what you know?",True,True,3
11981,9,1902,Winter,turkey,russia,That sounds like what the Italians proposed to me yea,True,True,-3
11982,9,1902,Winter,russia,turkey,"Excellent, that'll leave the Austrians on the ropes, we can think about moving on the Italians after that depending on the situation",True,True,3
11983,9,1903,Fall,turkey,russia,Sorry for the deception -- I only decided at the last minute and I also didn't want any leaks getting to Italy,False,True,-3

11986,9,1903,Fall,russia,turkey,Meaning that you'll poke Serbia to break any possible support of course.,True,True,3
11987,9,1903,Fall,turkey,russia,"Alright, will do, thanks for understanding",True,True,-3
11988,9,1904,Spring,turkey,russia,-- oof --,True,True,-7
11989,9,1904,Spring,russia,turkey,"Yeah, sorry. For what its worth I fuckin' hate doing this whole 'betrayal' thing to people. It's the worst part of this game. >.>",True,True,7
11990,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"Greetings, Russia!

We don't have too much to discuss early on, but I was curious on whether or not you were planning to move A Moscow - St Petersburg, where you could make a play for Norway.

And likewise, was curious whether you planned to order F Sevestapol - Black Sea, or else allow Turkey to occupy it.

It's early, but we might have room to cooperate against England or Germany in the future. Let's keep in touch. Good luck.",True,True,-1
11991,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,I'd be very interested in organizing a group effort against Britain right now. I likely won't move to Saint Petersburg the first turn in case the Germans try something but I'm definitely bouncing in the Black sea.,True,True,1
11992,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"Understood, what's your plan then? 

You might consider Moscow to Livonia, which would still improve your situation in the north (since you could convoy to Sweden and then build in StP), while also helping to cover Warsaw.

Or else you could just commit both of your armies to the south.",True,True,-1
11993,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"I've spoken with the Germans, and a group effort against the British is likely. I'm still considering various ways to secure my position better, but I think keeping one army put in Moscow offers the best stability for the time being; If the Germans are telling the truth it will likely move to secure a spot in Finland in the second year.",True,True,1
11994,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"I would advise against staying put. Both Ukraine and Livonia can defend 3/4 of your centers. St Petersburg  can't be attacked year 1 and the risk to Sevestapol is nominal in year 1, since even if he goes all out you bounce him out of Black Sea and he can only make an unsupported attempt from Armenia",True,True,-1
11995,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North,True,True,-1
11996,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"Perhaps you're right, but an emergency is more likely to materialize in the south, in the rare case that Austria might deploy full strength against me, and the utility of remaining in Moscow in that case is much greater. I prefer the overall flexibility to the ability to deploy quickly to Scandinavia personally.",True,True,1
11997,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"If you are concerned about the worst case on defense, I would order A Warsaw - Galicia and A Moscow - Ukraine",False,True,-1
11998,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"The absolute worst case is: 
A Berlin - Prussia or Silesia
A Smyrna - Armenia
F Ankara - Black Sea
A Vienna - Galicia
A Budapest S A Vienna - Galicia or - Rumania",True,True,-1
11999,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"Even in that nightmare scenario, you can defend all your centers with A Ukraine S Sev H (if Austria went to Rumania) or support Warsaw (if they went to Galicia with support)",False,True,-1
12000,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"I have to be careful not to provoke a worst case through concern for it. Remaining in Moscow on the first turn only marginally reduces my ability on the second turn in the north, while it retains the ability to support/ go south quickly if all goes wrong.",True,True,1
12001,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,I'm greatly tempted to take that army to Finland in any case.,True,True,1
12002,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"Have you talked to Italy? Even if you're not going for an Austrian offensive, they could provide a hedge against an Eastward move by Austria. You can also deny working together in the event that Austria is offended by this.",True,True,-1
12003,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"The Italians have been relatively tight lipped, they haven't spoken much more than the Austrians and the Austrians haven't spoken at all, which is concerning to say the least.",True,False,1
12004,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"That's... Interesting. In my experience with Italy, Russia is the one country you can rely on, since they're a potential ally against either Austria or Turkey. It's strange that they haven't been recruiting your alliance",True,True,-1
12005,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,I haven't heard from Austria either. They're the one player I haven't heard from,True,True,-1
12006,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,Well that's reassuring at least. Are the Germans on board for a sea lion in your opinion? They haven't responded to my counter-proposal after they requested they get Norway. Hard to tell if they are unsatisfied or if they simply haven't had time to respond.,True,True,1
12007,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"My conversation with Germany was very brief. All I know is that they agreed to a bounce on Burgundy, which is kind of a no brainer for them if they believe that I am going to Burgundy. Which I am, and I told them so.",True,True,-1
12008,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"Alright, they probably spoke to you in the same window of time that they did to me. Did you talk about which of you gets Belgium?",True,True,1
12009,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"We did not. Since I am expecting to get bounced in Burgundy and am not planning to enter the Channel in year 1, I will likely have no say in the Belgian question.",True,True,-1
12010,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,I am happy to let England and Germany fight for it,True,True,-1
12011,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"Well that reinforces my wish to disallow the Germans the use of Norway, if he's likely to get Belgium then he certainly doesn't need it.",True,True,1
12012,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,Indeed. Seems like a rather greedy fellow.,True,True,-1
12013,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"If I was less concerned about the British I'd not consider them as highly for alliance, temporary or otherwise.",True,True,1
12014,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,Interesting sentiment! What makes you so so concerned about the British?,True,True,-1
12015,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"I've seen too many Russias undone by British armies in St. Petersburg; their advantage in navy can easily push you out of Scandinavia and your only means to create fleets in the north. Of all Russia's existential threats, they're the worst one because they're Britain's easiest target.",True,True,1
12016,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"At the risk of harping on the same points, this is part of why I find it's important to maintain a strong presence in the north",True,True,-1
12017,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"With an army in St Petersburg (ideally), and a fleet in Sweden, not only can you pretty comfortably keep the English out of St Petersburg, you have pretty good odds of evicting them from Norway",True,True,-1
12018,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"You could even bounce them in Norway, where they would end up without a build",True,True,-1
12019,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"I get that, I just don't see Livonia as having any particular utility that Moscow doesn't have aside from the ability to convoy to Sweden or Finland; but Sweden is a position better served by a fleet anyways. Finland though, is a place built for armies, but I could get there easier via St. Petersburg. I'd like to bounce the Brits in Norway but it's imperative to keep St. Petersburg free for the 1902 build so that I can get a fleet there.",True,True,1
12020,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"I do think that Livonia strengthens your position in the North, but it's more helpful if your target enemy is Germany than England. It allows you to convoy into Sweden in Fall 1901, build in St Petersburg, and then use A St Petersburg and A Sweden to pressure Norway while F Gulf of Bothnia goes to the Baltic",True,True,-1
12021,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"If you commit three units to the south or stay in Moscow, you'll have at most one fleet and one army in the north. If you go to St Petersburg, you'll have that number at minimum, and if you convoy to Sweden you can realistically get to two fleets and an army",True,True,-1
12022,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,I admit that the concept is warming on me. It also doesn't telegraph to the British that you don't trust them.,True,True,1
12023,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"St Petersburg is vaguely unfriendly, but one which England may not feel pressured to take action on, especially if they are under pressure elsewhere. However, they will most likely see a move to Livonia as an anti-German or a defensive move than one against them.",True,True,-1
12024,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"True. Though the German perception of the move is a concern, as much as I don't relish them as allies, I especially don't need them as enemies.",True,True,1
12025,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"I personally think you can probably spin it as a defensive move, but I will acknowledge that it's hard to be sure when Germany has been so tight lipped",True,True,-1
12026,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"Right, I just need more communication all around me honestly. I've only really come to a decisive conclusion with the Turks.",True,True,1
12027,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"Yeah, other than yourself, Turkey and Italy have been the only other powers who have been really talkative",True,True,-1
12028,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"I've spoken to England and Germany enough to get the key points of alignments across, but not enough to build a relationship. Austria has been totally silent",True,True,-1
12029,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,The Italians have only talked to me briefly and the Turks and I just about talked enough to agree to stay out of each other's way and to organize a bounce in the Black Sea.,True,True,1
12030,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,That's the same level as my discussion with Germany - to align to stay out of each other's way.,True,True,-1
12031,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,Maybe it's a time zone issue. See if they talk overnight.,True,True,-1
12032,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"Perhaps, I just hope the Austrians aren't dead-on-arrival",True,True,1
12033,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"I mean, if they are, you are likely to be one of the beneficiaries. I should be the one saying that!",True,True,-1
12034,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,"You're right, it's just a much less interesting situation if I just get to walk into Budapest and/or Vienna!",True,True,1
12035,9,1901,Spring,france,russia,"Yeah, fair enough! Although it's only marginally worse than Austria just rolling over in the face of a Juggernaut alliance, as happens far too often.",True,True,-1
12036,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,That's true; Austria really bums people out but tbh it's my favorite to play.,True,True,1
12037,9,1901,Spring,russia,france,The Germans are really stuck on Norway for some reason.,True,True,1
12038,9,1901,Fall,russia,france,Those cheeky sons of bitches the Germans had me so goddamn worried about getting bounced in Sweden and they didn't even go to Denmark turn one.,True,True,1
12039,9,1901,Fall,france,russia,"Sorry for not responding sooner, I got a little drunk last night. But yeah, Austria isn't the strongest country, but playing Austria is kind of exciting in a way. Seems like in this game, both you and Germany are in good terms with them, so they'll probably be alright at least for now.",True,True,-1
12040,9,1901,Fall,russia,france,"Yeah, so long as they don't make any terrible mistakes",NOANNOTATION,True,1
12041,9,1901,Fall,france,russia,"Fixating on Norway and then not even going to Denmark is really strange. Not sure they can even get to Norway any time soon. Their move to HOlland instead is a little annoying for me and England, but shouldn't be the end of the world",True,True,-1
12042,9,1901,Fall,russia,france,"Yeah, I might just take Norway myself. Not any time soon mind, I need to get things relatively resolved in the south far before that.",True,True,1
12043,9,1901,Fall,france,russia,"Yeah, it's hard for England to set up a strong defensive position in Norway, and if they were in such a position they'd probably push onwards to StP. So as long as you sort things out defensively you can probably evict England later.",True,True,-1
12044,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,The English are getting rather unorthodox aren't they?,True,True,1
12045,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,"To be fair, that's partly because they successfully anticipated an unorthodox move by Germany to vacate HOlland",True,True,-1
12046,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,And you? I see you decided not to convoy to Sweden,True,True,-1
12047,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,"Army wouldn't do much good up there, still want to be able to pivot away if other issues arise. Better to potentially get the fleet out of the Baltic.",True,True,1
12048,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,"If you convoy, you could get to the Baltic anyways, while having A Sweden which pressures both Denmark and Norway, as opposed to the passive A Livonia",True,True,-1
12049,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,"No I mean out of the Baltic, the whole body of water, to the Skagerrak (Potentially)",True,True,1
12050,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,"Oh, that's more interesting",True,True,-1
12051,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,You would definitely need to get through England to get anywhere in that direction. Does that mean you're thinking of building in StP nc?,True,True,-1
12052,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,"Indeed, it's all a future thing though, I've got no plans as yet for anything like that, gotta resolve the south a bit better first. And yeah, I'm definitely building a fleet in StP NC, can't afford the Brits deciding that I look like an easy target.",True,True,1
12053,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,Words to live by! And I assume the second build will be an army in Warsaw? Where do you stand regarding Turkey and Austria?,True,True,-1
12054,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,"Warsaw's neutral ground, as agreed with the Germans, so the second comes in Moscow.",True,True,1
12055,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,"As far as Turkey and Austria goes, I'm inconclusive. Austria doesn't talk much but then again, neither does Turkey.",True,False,1
12056,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,"I feel like if you build in Moscow and already have a unit standing by in Livonia, you could very easily end up being very passive.",True,True,-1
12057,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,"Also, I just noticed Turkey's move to Armenia",True,True,-1
12058,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,"Yeah, Turkey and I are having a nice talk about that, as much as can be, but they don't seem particularly determined to come after me considering they didn't touch the Black Sea. That definitely contributes to the south being ""Inconclusive"" as I said.",True,True,1
12059,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,"They can though, at least if they're not afraid of the Austrians. They would just build a fleet in Ankara and support themsleves in",True,True,-1
12060,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,"That would be intensely concerning, but I very seriously doubt that Austria would be on board, and even if they are I don't feel as though the Italians would be interested.",True,True,1
12061,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,"That's true. I guess if you feel comfortable with Austria and Italy, it's a reasonable position",True,True,-1
12062,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,"Right, barring a worst case scenario the situation in the south is stable at least.",True,True,1
12063,9,1901,Winter,france,russia,But not especially looking to go on the offensive?,True,True,-1
12064,9,1901,Winter,russia,france,"Oh I will be, just depends on which one ends up being more convincing in the next half-day.",True,True,1
12065,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,Odd choice to build the fleet in Brest.,True,True,1
12066,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,Without any fleets in the north I will be too vulnerable to a potential English stab,True,True,-1
12067,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"Well we're of the same mind on that front at the very least. They certainly didn't appreciate when I did that though and I warned them in advance, did you at least clear it with them?",True,True,1
12068,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"I warned then in advance, but I'm not sure they saw it and they were unhappy either way",True,True,-1
12069,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"However, I think Germany's moves have locked England and Germany into conflict, and I'm sure he'll forget about it after some success on the German front",True,True,-1
12070,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"I wouldn't be so sure of that if I was you, the Italians tell me that the English are angrily blabbing about your plans to attack Italy with the forces you have in the south.",True,True,1
12071,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,There are no such plans... Time to do some damage control I guess,True,True,-1
12072,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"Yeah, I figured it seemed fishy since if you planned to attack the Italians surely you'd have built another fleet in Marseilles.",True,True,1
12073,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"You know, I hate to sound like a broken clock, but you could be in Liverpool before the British could even do anything to stop you, if you started now and were sufficiently sneaky about it.",True,True,1
12074,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"I'll definitely take that under advisement. Of course, it would be a lot more tempting if a foreign fleet were in the Norwegian Sea or something",True,True,-1
12075,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,I'm sure the British will be sufficiently distracted with trying to keep me from being tempted to take Norway and continuing the German campaign.,True,True,1
12076,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,Any pertinent information on the British plan that you know and/or are willing to give out by the way? Since they're being so imaginative with your plans and all.,True,True,1
12077,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"Nothing concrete, but they've indicated to me that they feel like they are on good terms with you, which might mean that they plan to prioritize defending Belgium over defending Norway",True,True,-1
12078,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"Sorry, Holland",True,True,-1
12079,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"Excellent, they'll definitely need to do that if they intend to keep that foothold and expand it.",True,True,1
12080,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"That does leave them vulnerable to an attack on Norway, however",True,True,-1
12081,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"They're either vulnerable to one or vulnerable to the other, they can't have a guaranteed hold on both until Fall, and that's only assuming that their positioning relative to Germany doesn't worsen significantly.",True,True,1
12082,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"Yeah, and the other complication is that they can only go to Norwegian Sea to shore up their position .",True,True,-1
12083,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"Indeed, if they move to the Helgoland Bight or Skagerrak to try and make room for more fleets to use against Germany they risk losing Netherlands and the foothold that they had established, with no more means of gaining ground against the Germans. If they had built in London they could move to the Channel to try and strongarm Belgium, but they built an army there instead.",True,True,1
12084,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"Of course if they felt comfortable with you, F Norway could go to Skagerrak to shore things up",True,True,-1
12085,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,If they felt comfortable I doubt they'd have bothered to build a fleet that can go directly to the Norwegian Sea rather than one that can almost immediately deploy to harass and/or support Belgium.,True,True,1
12086,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"To be honest I""m not sure I get the A London build at all. Liverpool is better placed for convoying since you could go to Clyde if you wanted to convoy through the North Sea",True,True,-1
12087,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"I understand and appreciate that, if he intended to respect our demilitarization of the English Channel and expected me to do the same, F Edinburgh is better than F London",True,True,-1
12088,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,But why A London then?,True,True,-1
12089,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"Yeah, it's not a terribly competent build order all things considered. The fact that in one turn Liverpool can move to be convoyed through any sea zone around Britain means that it's significantly better for that, London only makes sense as a sedentary defensive move.",True,True,1
12090,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"I'm not sure it makes sense even as a defensive move. IN the event that I stab and go to the channel, they would likely be reluctant to use A London to bounce the convoy in Wales",True,True,-1
12091,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"While it can obviously cover London itself, in that sense it is little better than Liverpool -> Yorkshire",True,True,-1
12092,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"That's very true. Even in the context of pure defense it doesn't make a great deal of sense, especially given the likelihood of an attack originating around Liverpool and Wales.",True,True,1
12093,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"I suspect the thought process was more on the lines of initially wanting to build a fleet in London, deciding I would likely see that as an act of aggression, and changing it to an army",True,True,-1
12094,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,Perhaps? Seems like an error of not enough foresight if that's the case.,True,True,1
12095,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,It still scans as a move to try and counter your influence or serve as a jumping off point for a surprise attack.,True,True,1
12096,9,1902,Spring,france,russia,"Even for a surprise attack, F Nth - Eng, A Liverpool - York would make more sense",True,True,-1
12097,9,1902,Spring,russia,france,"Yeah, I'm not sure what they're doing, or if they even know what they're doing.",True,True,1
12098,9,1902,Fall,russia,france,"Well, I feel pretty vindicated in taking Norway.",True,True,1
12099,9,1902,Fall,france,russia,Indeed. You should be able to hold both it and StP without much trouble now. Very aggressive attack by England,True,True,-1
12100,9,1902,Fall,russia,france,Just wish the Austrians hadn't decided to ruin literally everything.,True,True,1
12101,9,1902,Fall,france,russia,Look on the bright side. Turkey seems firmly in your camp now. With their help Austria should be easy to manage,True,True,-1
12102,9,1902,Fall,russia,france,Not without losses unfortunately. You know it might be more easy for me to put a fleet in the Norwegian sea if you didn't put so much pressure on the Germans.,True,True,1
12103,9,1902,Fall,france,russia,What assistance would you need from Germany? A Denmark is probably at your disposal - it can do nothing useful in the west. I've discussed with Germany a deal in which they take the North Sea but yield Belgium to me. They seemed receptive but it might just be saving face - you should approach them with a similar offer.,True,True,-1
12104,9,1902,Fall,russia,france,"You can no more help them take the North Sea than they can prevent you from taking Belgium, I think that the deal needs to be a bit better than that.",True,True,1
12105,9,1902,Fall,russia,france,"And I mostly just need Germany's fleets to be free and clear to operate without possibly being harassed by French troops, because with German fleets I can free myself from Scandinavia, free an army for use in the south, and just over-all better my position on the board.

You have their trust, you can convince them that because I'm going to use all my resources to clamp down Norway, meaning that they cannot possibly take it, and that since the Germans are obviously going to support Munich with the army in Kiel that they cannot take it. Furthermore, ""you got the Germans to admit"" That they will only be coming to Netherlands with the fleet in Belgium + the fleet in the Helgoland Bight.

Thus you suggest that they do a supported move to the Netherlands using F North Sea and A Ruhr to block that, while you take Belgium.

This will fool them sufficiently that the Germans can use the army in Kiel to support the fleet in Belgium into the Netherlands as well as the fleet in the Bight, ceding Belgium to you in the process, while also freeing me of one necessary support so that I can move from Sweden to Skagerrak, and the British lose two of their units this build phase.

I completely agree that the French-English alliance can be quite powerful. Naturally, the main sticking point early on is whether we can trust each other to demilitarize the Channel.
On my end, I have little reason to go there unless I distrust you. I plan to go to Mid-Atlantic, which would allow me to move to Spain (south coast) and establish an early presence in the Mediterranean. Will also aim to get into Burgundy, where I can potentially support you into Belgium.
My suggestion is that you open with:
F Edinburgh - Norwegian Sea
F London - North Sea 
A Liverpool - Yorkshire
This guarrenteed you a build in Norway even if Russia moves A Moscow north, while potentially letting you convoy into Belgium. And you can be safe in the knowledge that either A Yorkshire or F North Sea can cover London in the event that I don't keep my word.
Let me know your thoughts. Good luck to you as well!",True,True,0

12523,10,1901,Winter,austria,germany,"Speaking of England, one thing annoying about E/G alliances is that you really only have this one chance to build a fleet without signalling your change of intentions too obviously: now.  Right now, a Fleet Berlin build does not scare/worry your English ally, because it's clearly meant to pin down scandanavia (F Den S Ber-Bal, next season, F Bal S Den-Swe, and you work with England to support them into StP).  Any build of a fleet later is clearly meant to attack England, and they see it coming.

So if they're sensible, they'll just grumble loudly and ignore the loss in the north, biding their time to strike back once Turkey's subdued and they hope they can trust me to join them against you.  It's all in the timing, though!  I'd certainly not prefer it, but you could play nice with them, hoping you can work with them against *me* in the mid-game.

I tend to love A/T alliances, with Austria building lots of armies and Turkey going mostly fleets (because breaking through to the Ionian Sea can be pretty hard otherwise).

One strategy I've sometimes found useful when getting tag-teamed by forces more numerous than my own: ask a neighbor to come to your aid, with the promise that if I start to collapse, I'll let that neighbor take my centers to spike those who are attacking me.  In this case, you could ask Italy to move Ven-Pie, so that they can support Marseille, or if you're really struggling at some point, they can take it from you and use that to help you hold E+G at bay until they inevitably start fighting each other.  In fact, once Italy is on your doorstep and E+G see this, the mere threat of someone else getting your supply centers sometimes leads to them attacking each other instead.",False,True,1
