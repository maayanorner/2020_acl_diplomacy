0,11,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"Good afternoon to our friends in the south, just sending this message to open a channel for future relations when ever they need to happen, and to say 'howdy and have a good game' to you.",True,True,0
1,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Of course! I thank you very much. The future of the Kaissereich and its effect on my neighbors will be very important to me, so tell me if you want help to dissuade attack.",True,True,0
2,11,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"Well, should the French turn out to be a thorn in my side I would greatly appreciate the aid",True,True,0
3,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,Greetings from new Italy!,True,True,0
4,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Would just like to reiterate that Italy would likely take an opportunistic stance towards France - their defensive position is strong enough that I won't attack them proactively, but if they are locked into a conflict with you I might stab them",True,True,0
5,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"So in that sense Italy is broadly friendly to your interests - if you and France are allied I will leave you alone, but if France is your enemy I could potentially help you to break a stalemate",True,True,0
6,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"But what I'd need in exchange is for you to keep me posted on developments in the west. Are you leaning towards working with England, or France?",True,True,0
7,11,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"It seems for the moment that both are cooperative, but I'm likely to side with the French from the outset barring difficulties with them. I'll keep you posted, same relationship as previously established. In any case, friendship with the French is not very likely to last past England's demise so I'll definitely need the help then. Thank!",True,True,0
8,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Makes sense. Hopefully I'll be on the winning side of a conflict against Turkey or Austria by then, which should put us in position to squeeze France",True,True,0
9,11,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"I'd greatly prefer you end up on Austria's side of that conflict all things considered, but if things don't go his way I wouldn't blame you for siding against them.",True,True,0
10,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Definitely understandable. But since Italy starts off as one of the weaker countries, I basically need to play a little opportunistically",True,True,0
11,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,The elephant in the room is Russia - would you have any insight on what they're planning?,True,True,0
12,11,1901,Spring,germany,italy,Unfortunately we only talked very briefly about staying out of each other's ways.,True,True,0
13,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,Haha didn't try to hold Sweden hostage to get him to play nice with Austria? That's my usual go-to as Germany lol,True,True,0
14,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,Have you talked more with Austria? I must admit to being concerned about you moving to Tyrolia in their defense,True,True,0
15,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,Since that would allow the two of you to launch a pretty credible attack on Venetia,True,True,0
16,11,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"As Germany I generally play somewhat more careful, get them to just promise not to be an enemy until the Western Triple becomes a Western Double. As far as Austria goes, we're allied, hence my preference for Turkey being your foe rather than them. I've no intent of turning South though, not by any means. Don't have the pieces for that.",True,True,0
17,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Yeah, fair enough. I'm planning on a pretty standard opening to Ionian Sea, aiming to convoy to Tunis and with a bounce in Austria",True,True,0
18,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"It's a pretty noncommittal move, so will wait and see how things play out",True,True,0
19,11,1901,Spring,italy,germany,But I'm sure nobody will miss the fact that it sets me up for the Lepanto if the cards fall that wau,True,True,0
20,11,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"Well the Lepanto setup is generally considered Italy's best opener, regardless of whether they trust Austria, hard to argue with a classic.",True,True,0
21,11,1901,Fall,germany,italy,It's looking like the Russians and the Turks are trying a Juggernaut.,True,True,0
22,11,1901,Fall,germany,italy,"If they do that, we desperately need to be strongly allied with the Austrians, otherwise they'll roll us over, hard.",True,True,0
23,11,1901,Fall,italy,germany,"I am also concerned about the Juggernaut, which pushes me towards you and Austria's camp",True,True,0
24,11,1901,Fall,italy,germany,"It seems France and England are at a loggerhead already, so if you side with England it might be an opportunity for me as well",True,True,0
25,11,1901,Fall,italy,germany,"Our interests are aligned in both sides of the map, so let's just coordinate closely",True,True,0
26,11,1902,Spring,italy,germany,I'd be more comfortable committing both fleets east to support Austria against Turkey if I knew you were going to Burgundy (which makes it harder for France to convoy to Tuscany),True,True,-1
27,11,1902,Spring,italy,germany,France's F Marseille is a major headache for me,True,True,-1
28,11,1902,Spring,italy,germany,What say you?,True,True,-1
29,11,1902,Fall,germany,italy,"France is definitely going to be a thorn in your side, unfortunately I can neither afford to attack them right now nor likely convince them to not attack you, they're more powerful than I am and I've already pissed off two of my three potentially unfriendly neighbors.",True,True,1
30,11,1902,Fall,germany,italy,"The Balkan Front is pretty secure for you two though, you can at least hold and with some tricky maneuvering, very easily begin advancing through the Turks.",True,True,1
31,11,1902,Fall,italy,germany,Understood. Know that Austria and Italy are not going to be able to hold out against Russia and Turkey,True,True,-1
32,11,1902,Fall,italy,germany,"If you want to prevent a juggernaut, we will need whatever help from you we can get",True,True,-1
33,11,1902,Fall,germany,italy,"Well, as I'm sure you've noticed, I've mobilized for the task.",True,True,1
34,11,1902,Fall,germany,italy,"I've talked to the French to try and get them off your back, but they're dedicated to seeing you off. They told me to tell you that they plan to attack Piedmont with support, which indicates that they're probably planning a convoy to Tuscany. You can't let that happen.",True,True,1
35,11,1902,Winter,italy,germany,"Well, it seems the attack on Piedmont with support was genuine, which seems like a very poor decision by the French",True,True,0
36,11,1902,Winter,germany,italy,"Yeah, maybe they predicted that you'd think they were lying to me? Regardless, bad move on their part in any case, especially since you have a build.",True,True,0
37,11,1902,Winter,italy,germany,"Good news for you though. A distracted France is still more than enough firepower to get you through England, and it makes it easy for you to stab them after",True,True,0
38,11,1902,Winter,italy,germany,"I don't know whether you deliberately leaked me that intel thinking I would disbelieve it and go to Tuscany, but no hard feeling if so",True,True,0
39,11,1902,Winter,italy,germany,That's jsut well played,True,True,0
40,11,1902,Winter,germany,italy,"It certainly does, I wish they'd let you get on with destroying the Turks so you could focus fire on them when it's needed but still. And I gave you that information because I genuinely thought that their objective would be to get you to expect what they told me to tell you so they could do something else. Was worried that they'd do the convoy because that would be devastating for you.",True,True,0
41,11,1902,Winter,italy,germany,"Haha honestly that risk was very top of mind for me, since I attempted the same convoy as France in the previous game",True,True,0
42,11,1902,Winter,italy,germany,So would likely have made the risk averse move to avoid the convoy even without the warning,True,True,0
43,11,1902,Winter,germany,italy,"Yeah, it's a real power-move as the French to pull off that convoy.",True,True,0
44,11,1902,Winter,italy,germany,"Well, it didn't work for me either",True,True,0
45,11,1902,Winter,germany,italy,"Well, experienced Italys generally see it coming.",True,True,0
46,11,1902,Winter,italy,germany,Indeed.,True,True,0
47,11,1903,Spring,germany,italy,"I'm trying to do damage control with the Austrians. It was incredibly damaging for them to do that and I can't imagine why they've decided to side with the Turks rather than you. If it doesn't work out, I'm going to go nuclear and split them lengthways with the Turks.",True,True,0
48,11,1903,Spring,italy,germany,I was taken very surprised in large part because I didn't see - and still don't see - what they stand to gain,True,True,0
49,11,1903,Spring,italy,germany,"And if they really stand to gain ground, why not make a play for Venice?",True,True,0
50,11,1903,Spring,germany,italy,"No idea, the y apparently aren't interested in working with you anymore. I'm quite frankly pulling my hair over this, it's the worst possible move.",True,True,0
51,11,1903,Fall,italy,germany,"I find myself very confused by it as well, which is part of why I am not quite sure how to respond",True,True,0
52,11,1904,Spring,italy,germany,Would you be willing to coordinate against A Tyrolia? I'd be happy to support A Munich in,True,True,-3
53,11,1904,Spring,germany,italy,"I'm afraid that if I do that, my current position could quickly become untenable. I'm worried that the Austrians are planning something funky.",True,True,3
54,11,1904,Fall,germany,italy,"Alright, so, I realize that this is a little bit late, but now that the Austrians are embroiled with the Turks, I am moving against the French. I'm trying to convince the Austrians that its in their best interests to join back with you, but I would understand if you might resent him or both of us for our failure to consistently side with you.",True,True,3
55,11,1904,Winter,italy,germany,You stabbing the French is already a massive lifeline to me. I could not in good conscious ask you to do more,True,True,-6
56,11,1904,Winter,italy,germany,"I will listen to what Austria has to say, and keep you updated on that front. I do not really trust them, but I may still be willing to work with them against the Turks if they say the right things",True,True,-6
57,11,1904,Winter,germany,italy,"I'm moving on the French this next season, hopefully they'll pull back to face me and you and the British will be able to surge back against them.",True,True,6
58,11,1904,Winter,italy,germany,I'm pleasantly surprised that you're so willing to work with England as well,True,True,-6
59,11,1904,Winter,italy,germany,In that case i'll play defensively but try to set myself up for a counteroffensive,True,True,-6
60,11,1904,Winter,germany,italy,"Well the English are a little miffed that I didn't move last season, but still, I see no reason not to work with them for the time being.",True,True,6
61,11,1905,Spring,italy,germany,"Yeah, agreed. The English are too desperate to turn down your support",True,True,-6
62,11,1905,Spring,italy,germany,"Conversely, you have a free walk into Paris right now",True,True,-6
63,11,1905,Spring,italy,germany,Since France has only fleets,True,True,-6
64,11,1905,Spring,italy,germany,"A Mun - Bur and then to Paris is guarrenteed to succeed as long as you can cover a potential stab on Mun, which you could easily do with A Ber",True,True,-6
65,11,1905,Spring,italy,germany,"And then A Hol-Bel isn't quite as foolproof, but is pretty safe as well",True,True,-6
66,11,1905,Spring,italy,germany,Especially if you support yourself into NTH and move Kie - Hol,True,True,-6
67,11,1905,Spring,germany,italy,"If you're wondering who convinced the French to make it a fleet, you need go no further",True,True,6
68,11,1905,Spring,italy,germany,"Well, sounds like things are in good shape!",True,True,-6
69,11,1905,Spring,germany,italy,Hopefully the French are sufficiently distracted that you can launch a counter attack.,True,True,6
70,11,1905,Fall,italy,germany,"Yeah, I'll make the most of this",True,True,-6
71,11,1906,Spring,germany,italy,"The Austrians wouldn't happen to be talking about me, would they?",True,True,8
72,11,1906,Spring,italy,germany,I haven't heard anything from them,True,True,-8
73,11,1906,Spring,germany,italy,"Well, at the very least that's good. I'm worried about them potentially deciding that they want Warsaw, despite the fact that I'm on the right side of a stalemate line where they'd only get 1 supply center if they attacked.",True,True,8
74,11,1906,Fall,germany,italy,Are you coordinating with the Turks? I think that for the time being that would be a good idea.,True,True,8
75,11,1906,Fall,italy,germany,"Yeah, am trying to do so",True,True,-8
76,11,1906,Fall,germany,italy,"Not to be needy or anything, but I would greatly appreciate a hard move for Venice this next year.",NOANNOTATION,True,8
77,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,I will make a play for Venice this Fall,True,True,-8
78,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,"If I was in Austria's shoes, I would do a self bounce of F Ven - Tri, A Ser - Tri",True,True,-8
79,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,"So I plan to do F Alb S F Ven - Tri, A Apu - Ven",True,True,-8
80,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,Odds of succeeding in this improve dramatically if also support with A Tyr S A Apu - Ven - would you be willing to do so?,True,True,-8
81,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,"Gas and Bur likely cannot take Mar anyways, so in my view you would be better off using:
A Par & A Pic S A Gas - Bre
F NTH S F Bel - ENG
A Bur - Mun",True,True,-8
82,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,"This would be a near-guarantee that you take Brest and would occupy F ENG as a consolation prize in the only outcome where you didn't, while still covering Munich",True,True,-8
83,11,1907,Fall,germany,italy,"My only problem with that plan is that it risks losing Burgundy if the French pull a fast one and go for Silesia instead, while moving Marseilles into Burgundy.",True,True,8
84,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,That's a valid point. My view is that A Mar - Bur is unlikely but A Boh - Sil is a real risk,True,True,-8
85,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,"If you want to keep France out of Bohemia, A Gal is the only unit you have that can do so",True,True,-8
86,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,Which might be a better investment that using it to try and snipe Bud,True,True,-8
87,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,"Although actually, if you hit Vienna and France has two disbands, they may struggle to keep up the pressure around Silesia",True,True,-8
88,11,1907,Fall,germany,italy,"That's true, I don't know if I want to take my chances with that though.",True,True,8
89,11,1907,Fall,germany,italy,"I'll probably move into Vienna, but I'm not sure I can afford to move out of Burgundy.",True,True,8
90,11,1907,Fall,italy,germany,"Understood, So then you would use A Gal to cover Warsaw, A Bur to cover Munich, and then try to snipe Vienna with A Tyr?",True,True,-8
91,11,1907,Fall,germany,italy,Correct,True,True,8
92,11,1901,Spring,austria,italy,How’s it going Italy?,True,True,0
93,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"Relatively well. I'm doing a small concert soon, so kind of nervous, honestly. How about you?",True,True,0
94,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"I'm assuming we can both agree to a nonaggression pact, and that you too were told to Lepanto the Turks (though I'm not sure if its a good idea)?",True,True,0
95,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"We're the only ones I trust to understand how unlikely a Solo is, and you seem interested in cooperation, so I'll honestly put all my chips under your bag and defend you until the end if you're willing to do the same with me.",True,True,0
96,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"At the very least, we can give one hell of a ride.",True,True,0
97,11,1901,Spring,austria,italy,"I haven’t been told to do a Lepanto yet, who said that? And yes I would like peace on our front, I could have a three front war at any time so it would be great if you and I did not fight. Where would you expand to then?",True,True,0
98,11,1901,Spring,austria,italy,I will be moving into Ven with Tri (traditional Austrian opening) and fully understand that you would go Ven to Tri as a response so that we bounce. If you can come up with a good alternative then I am fine with that but I don’t see one.,True,True,0
99,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"I am perfectly comfortable with a Ven-Tri bounce, so no need for further discussion on that point. Would like to suggest that we demilitarize Tyrolia, at least for year one as well",True,True,0
100,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"Would like to get your thoughts on your other moves? Is A Budapest going to Serbia, and is A Vienna going to Galicia or allowing Russia in?",True,True,0
101,11,1901,Spring,austria,italy,Okay the bounce sounds good. And I would love to demilitarize Tyr for this year and we can talk about it again then,True,True,0
102,11,1901,Spring,austria,italy,Why do you need my moves?,True,True,0
103,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"I think in general it pays to know as much as possible about what everyone is doing. Even if they lie, it helps you get an early picture on who is trustworthy :p",True,True,0
104,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,But I think the Austria Italy relationship is bigger than that,True,True,0
105,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,Austria and Italy are two countries which can easily fall into a mutually destructive war until they both get eaten by Turkey,True,True,0
106,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"But it's also very hard for us to trust each other, since it's so easy to stab. That's a big part of what makes these two countries so challenging for a lot of players, right?",True,True,0
107,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"In that sense, it helps for us to be open with each other. It's a very different game for me if Russia gets into Galicia early, putting them and Turkey in place to roll the map, compared to if you and Turkey push Russia out of Rumania in year one",True,True,0
108,11,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"In that context, I'm pretty comfortable telling you that I don't plan to get greedy in year 1 - as long as I can secure Tunisia while keeping a secure defensive position, I'm happy",True,True,0
109,11,1901,Fall,austria,italy,I 100% do not want to fight you. I agree that Austria Italy is a war that often happens but never really works out for either side. We would just stagnate until russia or turkey or both took us out.,True,True,0
110,11,1901,Fall,austria,italy,On that note I have heard rumors that turkey and Russia are gonna go for a juggernaut. If that is the case I’d assume you would help me slow them down.,True,True,0
111,11,1901,Fall,austria,italy,Probably don’t need to point this out but you allying with turkey would eventually lead to him attacking you unless you stabbed him first,True,True,0
112,11,1901,Fall,italy,austria,"Definitely agree that, assuming we can trust each other, the Austria-Italy alliance tends to be more stable than the Austria-Turkey one",True,True,0
113,11,1901,Fall,italy,austria,"Turkey and Russia bounced in the Black Sea, but that proves little since Juggernaut allies often go for that anyways",True,True,0
114,11,1901,Fall,italy,austria,"Russia has committed pretty hard to the south, which is mildly concerning for both of us. In the event that the Juggernaut materializes however, my sense is that Germany would also be willing to support us",True,True,0
115,11,1901,Fall,italy,austria,"I guess for this year, suggest that we do the Ven-Tri bounce again. I would suggest to keep Turkey out of Greece and use Vienna to defend against Russia.",True,True,0
116,11,1901,Fall,italy,austria,I will convoy A Apulia to Tunisia,True,True,0
117,11,1901,Fall,austria,italy,All sounds good to me,True,True,0
118,11,1901,Fall,austria,italy,Have you talked to turkey much?,True,True,0
119,11,1901,Winter,italy,austria,Not a whole lot. Their move to the Black Sea was news to me,True,True,0
120,11,1901,Winter,austria,italy,So turkey went back on their deal with me and tried to let russia get rum while they snuck into Gre. Juggernaut confirmed,True,True,0
121,11,1901,Winter,austria,italy,I’d like to propose that you and I go full alliance,True,True,0
122,11,1901,Winter,italy,austria,"I'm game for the Lepanto, and it seems Germany is on board as well",True,True,0
123,11,1901,Winter,italy,austria,"What does that look like in practice? Germany builds in Berlin, you in Budapest",True,True,0
124,11,1901,Winter,italy,austria,And then hit Rumania in Spring?,True,True,0
125,11,1901,Winter,austria,italy,Not positive what I would do yet but something along those lines. You would definitely build a fleet in Nap and then move ION to EAS,True,True,0
126,11,1902,Spring,austria,italy,"France and Turkey are trying to get me to attack you, obviously I will not do that",True,True,0
127,11,1902,Spring,italy,austria,"With the build in Marseilles, France's goals are quite transparent",True,True,0
128,11,1902,Spring,italy,austria,Turkey will likely bounce me in EAS. Would you be willing to support me into Greece (via convoy)?,True,True,0
129,11,1902,Spring,italy,austria,"From there, I can support you into Bulgaria",True,True,0
130,11,1902,Spring,austria,italy,I’m willing to debate it but I had a different view on this turn. I figured he would bounce you in EAS but what if you went for AEG instead? Unless you’re worried about over extending yourself due to France. Because I trust you enough at this point to move Tri to Alb and then we will definitely be able to get Gre in the fall.,True,True,0
131,11,1902,Spring,italy,austria,Which makes going to AEG/EAS a bit of an overstretch,True,True,0
132,11,1902,Spring,italy,austria,If we can get Germany on board I'd feel a lot more comfortable with committing east,True,True,0
133,11,1902,Spring,italy,austria,"Sorry, some connection issues on my end so messages sent out of order",True,True,0
134,11,1902,Spring,italy,austria,"But basically I'm concerned about France's F Marseille, so a little nervous about committing both fleets east",True,True,0
135,11,1902,Spring,italy,austria,But I think having Germany attack France would ease that,True,True,0
136,11,1902,Spring,austria,italy,"So in theory if we could not get germany to attack France, what kind of attack would you be comfortable with us making",True,True,0
137,11,1902,Spring,italy,austria,In which case convoying onto Greece is the best use of the fleet and army I'd have available,True,True,0
138,11,1902,Spring,austria,italy,"Okay I will support that, can you move out of Ven?",True,True,0
139,11,1902,Fall,austria,italy,So I am in a slightly sticky situation but I think I can get out of it. If I support you holding in Gre then would you move that fleet into EAS?,True,True,0
140,11,1902,Fall,austria,italy,"Also Germany and France are allied, however Germany is also willing to help us out",True,True,0
141,11,1902,Fall,austria,italy,Let me know what you’re thinking,True,True,0
142,11,1902,Fall,italy,austria,"Germany and France allying is not ideal for me, but I feel confident in observing that Turkey and Russia are allied as well",True,True,0
143,11,1902,Fall,italy,austria,So desperate times call for desperate measures - may need to do what needs to be done to stop the juggernaut,True,True,0
144,11,1902,Fall,italy,austria,"Would appreciate you helping me to hold in Greece, and we'll need whatever help from Germany that we can get",True,True,0
145,11,1902,Fall,italy,austria,"I can still support A Serbia - Buglaria as well, if that helps",True,True,0
146,11,1902,Fall,austria,italy,"Look at the moves from last turn, turkey tried to support me attacking Russia. Why do you think they are still allied?",True,True,0
147,11,1902,Winter,italy,austria,"To put it simply, I missed that. I find Backstabbr's map interface hard to read, and didn't see it in the list of orders",True,True,0
148,11,1902,Winter,italy,austria,Which I will look at more carefully going forward,True,True,0
149,11,1902,Winter,austria,italy,"I gotcha, so you are clearly going after Turkey right now but have to deal with France. What’re you thinking in regards to that whole situation. Because I have to figure out whether or not I can use turkey as a short term ally vs Russia",True,True,0
150,11,1902,Winter,austria,italy,However I view you as my most important ally which is why I’m asking you about all this,True,True,0
151,11,1902,Winter,italy,austria,"I have moved against Turkey, but I am willing to back down to focus on France",True,True,0
152,11,1902,Winter,italy,austria,"If you would rather coordinate with Turkey against Russia, I'm open to the idea of a southern triple as Turkey suggested",True,True,0
153,11,1902,Winter,austria,italy,I mean turkey knows that you and I are allied so I think that if you attack him then he will attack me. I don’t really wanna fight him and russia at the same time,True,True,0

399,11,1910,Spring,turkey,italy,"The key to not losing to the solo is - assuming the loss of Portugal (which is two coin flips) - not losing 2 of the 3 Russian centers.  You're going to lose STP.  The question then becomes, how to we preserve Warsaw?  My recommendation is: 
A: VIE S TYR - BOH
A: WAR - UKR
A: STP - MOS
A: BUD - GAL
I: TYR - BOH
I: TRI - TYR
I: VEN - PIE
I: TUS S VEN - PIE
T: SEV - UKR
T: RUM S WAR - UKR
T: ANK - SEV (Convoy)

This plan destroys UKR or ensures that we control it.  It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.

529,11,1902,Fall,austria,germany,My only reasoning behind you supporting me in is that it guarantees we take it even if he supports it holding with Gal. They only way for this to 100% work is both of yours supporting me in,True,True,-1

554,11,1902,Fall,austria,germany,"That’s true, to be honest my reasoning is that Turkey is freaking out about you and if I support you in I might lose him for good. For that reason he wants me to cut support in Sev so that he can take Rum or attack Mos to either take that or bounce it. I don’t wanna do either of those things so I thought if you support me in then you are happy because russia loses a center, Turkey is happy because you don’t gain one, and I am happy because I gain one",True,True,-1

556,11,1902,Fall,germany,austria,"Well the real problem in any case is that if you get too buddy buddy with the Turks, the Italians lose a lot of incentive to be your ally and gain a lot of incentive to hit you while your back's turned.",True,True,1
557,11,1902,Fall,germany,austria,And the Turks honestly don't have more than a tenuous and temporary reason to be your friend either.,True,True,1
558,11,1902,Fall,austria,germany,"Totally understand that, I don’t want to be allied with the Turks but warring them and Russia at the same time is a pain in the ass.

559,11,1902,Fall,germany,austria,"Yeah, once the Russians lose Warsaw they're on the ropes and have very little chance of stopping us, and the Balkans are pretty well tied up in any case as long as the Italians remain dedicated.",True,True,1
560,11,1902,Fall,austria,germany,"I am still talking to Italy and would have no issues with them attacking turkey, I just don’t want turkey attacking me. As for an Italian stab, they are now in a position where attacking me is a multi turn process that I would see coming",True,True,-1

676,11,1906,Spring,germany,austria,Unless you can think of anyone else who we'd include.,True,True,4

696,11,1906,Fall,austria,germany,Most Italians just start a fight with Austria without reaching out to other people that’s the issue,True,True,-4
697,11,1906,Fall,germany,austria,I suppose it's another one that requires really good coordination. I can never convince the French it isn't worth it though.,True,True,4
698,11,1906,Fall,austria,germany,As Italy?,True,True,-4
699,11,1906,Fall,austria,germany,These games through the study are the only ones I have ever really played where France goes for Italy. I don’t know if it’s because players are more experienced here or just a coincidence,True,True,-4

710,11,1906,Fall,germany,austria,So I just realized that my mind made a goof and Warsaw doesn't border Bohemia. Would you mind terribly if I moved into Galicia to help ensure you can expel the French? From there we can mutually bounce in Budapest while displacing Venice (Assuming that you don't successfully occupy Budapest in Spring). You'll need to hold Budapest on your own power for the first turn though.,True,True,4

716,11,1907,Fall,germany,austria,Do you think it'd be a good idea for me to temporarily occupy Vienna to deprive the French of the dot? Or would you be uncomfortable with that you think,True,True,5

727,11,1908,Fall,germany,austria,"There's basically only two ways for this to finish, four way draw and German victory. I hate to say it and I won't suggest one over the other to you, but I think it should be clear which I'd greatly prefer.",True,True,7
728,11,1908,Fall,austria,germany,Ya plus I just messed up,True,True,-7

A: VIE S TYR - BOH
A: WAR - UKR
A: STP - MOS
A: BUD - GAL
I: TYR - BOH
I: TRI - TYR
I: VEN - PIE
I: TUS S VEN - PIE
T: SEV - UKR
T: RUM S WAR - UKR
T: ANK - SEV (Convoy)

This plan destroys UKR or ensures that we control it.  It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.
