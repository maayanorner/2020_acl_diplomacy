1,12,1901,Spring,italy,germany,"Well....that's a great question, and a lot of it comes down to how free I'll be left to play in the West, no?",True,True,0
2,12,1901,Spring,germany,italy,"Well, if you want to attack France in the Mediterranean while I attack through Burgundy you can have Marseille and Iberia while I take Brest and Paris, then with France out of the way you could focus on Turkey or Austria. Sound fair?",False,True,0
3,12,1901,Winter,germany,italy,"Hello, I'm just asking about your move to Tyrolia. It's making me more than a little concerned",True,True,1
4,12,1901,Winter,italy,germany,Totally understandable - but did you notice the attempt at Trieste?  Tyrolia is the natural support position for that attempt 🙂,False,True,-1

6,12,1901,Spring,italy,austria,"Bongiorno!  To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of their women!  I mean, umm, not really sure yet.  Pondering whether or not to make an early play around Munich",True,True,0
7,12,1901,Spring,austria,italy,"I'd personally rather you didn't, because a play around Munich is also a play around Trieste and Vienna. I've heard that there's some rancor over in the West and you might be able to profit from a mobbed France if you went that way.",True,False,0

12,12,1902,Fall,austria,italy,Indeed.,True,True,1
13,12,1902,Fall,italy,austria,Peccato.  I was really hoping we could bring order (or at least mutual profit) out of the chaos.,True,True,-1

24,12,1901,Spring,turkey,italy,"We both hate how I vs T just slows us both down, right?  Why do we have to be the slow powers in this game?  I say: we don't!  Let's be unconventional.  I have done fun I/T alliances before, but it all depends on making it work.  Let me know if you have any thoughts, or want to just see how the first few seasons roll out, or if there are things you'd like to see from me.",True,True,0

27,12,1903,Spring,turkey,italy,hahahahaha really?,True,True,1
28,12,1903,Spring,turkey,italy,"If Austria retreats to one of your centers, I guess it means they don't care about trying to repair anything with you, and Just Loves Them Dots, yeah?",True,True,1
29,12,1903,Spring,turkey,italy,"I may be able to hit Tri in the fall, which would cut it's ability to support Ven, by the way.  If Ion retreats to Adr, that may not help you, but if it retreats to Tun or Nap it would, I guess?  Let's see how the retreats go.",True,True,1
30,12,1903,Fall,italy,turkey,"So, now his dots are a LOT closer to you than mine are. 😃

I'm guessing you're ordering into Trieste anyway to protect Serbia while you take Greece with Bulgaria and Aegean. So the question is what is ion doing?",True,True,-1
31,12,1903,Fall,turkey,italy,"It's at your disposal if you want support into Tunis, if that's what you're getting at.",True,True,1
32,12,1903,Fall,italy,turkey,"Oh, come now. It's much more amusing to support you into Tunis. That advances the positions rather than retards them",True,True,-1
33,12,1903,Fall,turkey,italy,"Bwa! are you serious?  I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I feel like I'm greedy enough stabbing Austria for 3!",True,True,1
34,12,1903,Fall,italy,turkey,"Any other arrangement opens me for a stab and sets us up for conflict. Tunis is better for you than Naples, and it's a lot better for me to have you there with a path forward than tied up with me. If you feel bad about it, support me to Trieste",True,True,-1
35,12,1903,Fall,turkey,italy,"Ok, that's totally sensible logic.  I may end up having to pass up on Greece and catch it next year.  I can support you into Trieste, if you'd rather have that than retaking Venice, sure.",True,True,1
36,12,1903,Fall,turkey,italy,"Oh nevermind, you can get both, nice!",True,True,1
37,12,1903,Fall,turkey,italy,"unless Gre taps Ser, in which case you still recapture Ven, and Austria is stranded in Tri.",True,True,1
38,12,1903,Fall,italy,turkey,"Correct. Which is what I'm expecting, but I can hope for Trieste. 😀",True,True,-1
39,12,1903,Fall,italy,turkey,You heartless bastard - I can't believe you took him from 5 to 0.,True,True,-1
40,12,1903,Fall,turkey,italy,"It was kinder this way. Put ‘em out of their misery, y’know?",True,True,1
41,12,1903,Fall,italy,turkey,Lol. Probably. That is the great thing about Austria -you either do well or you get to go play another game.,True,True,-1
42,12,1903,Fall,turkey,italy,"Yep. I’m finishing up game 10 of this series now as Austria. Currently on 14 centers, but England has Tunis so no win for me 😦",True,True,1
43,12,1903,Winter,italy,turkey,"Ah, well.  
So, what's the plan from here?  How far are you planning on riding that juggernaut?",True,True,-5
44,12,1904,Spring,turkey,italy,"Well I want to see Russia moves hard on Germany. If they do, well I have a history of jumping on big openings, y’know? :). Otherwise fleets are heading toward Gibraltar!",True,True,5
45,12,1904,Spring,italy,turkey,Sounds fun!,True,True,-5
46,12,1904,Spring,italy,turkey,"Also, weirdly, my phone doesn't seem to be updating me with latest messages the way it should, so I end up seeing these a lot later than I should",True,True,-5
47,12,1904,Fall,turkey,italy,"So I tried to move towards a more forward position so I could fight France an d stab Russia, and *not* fight you, but you’re kinda putting yourself directly in my way, y’know?",True,True,5
48,12,1904,Fall,turkey,italy,I could’ve kept you out of Ion permanently but that wasn’t what I thought was very interesting long term. :/,True,True,5
49,12,1904,Fall,italy,turkey,"Yeah, I wasn't seeing any response from you, so I moved to defend.  We're having some communication issues based on mis-timing, I think.  Cost us most of a turn, but we have the weekend to work out a way forward, nu?",False,True,-5
50,12,1904,Fall,turkey,italy,"Sure, understood.  How about this to fix it: Tys S Tun-Wes, Ion-Tun?  You take back a dot, but we push the position forwards toward Iberia?",True,False,5
51,12,1904,Fall,turkey,italy,are you still not getting any messages from me?,True,True,5
52,12,1904,Fall,italy,turkey,That could definitely work - and it does advance the positions,True,True,-5
53,12,1904,Fall,italy,turkey,"Otherwise this game is going to be a long, unpleasant slog",True,True,-5
54,12,1904,Fall,italy,turkey,I get your messages fine on the computer - it's the phone that seems to not update properly for some reason.  I just hadn't checked the computer yesterday as I should have 🙂,True,True,-5
55,12,1904,Fall,turkey,italy,"Ok, France has told me outright they're wanting to make sure that ""Italy is divided fairly"", so I doubt they'll expect me pushing past you toward the west.",True,True,5
56,12,1904,Fall,italy,turkey,"Looks that way, yes",True,True,-5
57,12,1905,Spring,turkey,italy,"It's too bad we can't find a way to work together to force me out into MAO, instead of whittling down your defenses season by season.  Once you lose a center, this is going to crumble really quickly, but I'd totally be willing to try something else, even though we both didn't do what we said we do last season.",True,True,4
58,12,1905,Spring,italy,turkey,"Aye, it's not a *great* plan to just turtle up and try to outlast the juggernaut.  Would love to see or be shown a better option.",True,True,-4
59,12,1905,Spring,turkey,italy,"Yeah.  For this season, there’s no point in trying to negotiate something: the risk is too high for you on a fall turn.  But maybe once you’re turtled up and we’re looking at a slightly safer spring move, we can discuss some way to slingshot me past you",True,False,4
60,12,1905,Fall,italy,turkey,Absolutely.,True,True,-4
61,12,1905,Fall,italy,turkey,And sorry for slow reply - been traveling,True,True,-4

71,12,1901,Spring,italy,france,"Shoot, I was running through the messages so fast I forgot about your proposal by the time I responded.  Sounds like you might have enough on your hands without me annoying you in sensitive spaces, so I'm happy to honor such a DMZ",True,True,0

73,12,1901,Fall,italy,france,"Oh, gdi.  Now I have to tell a truth that sounds like the most cliched lie in the game: my order update didn't take, I wasn't intending to go to Piedmont.  Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous, but in this case true.",False,True,0
74,12,1901,Fall,italy,france,"Good news is that with your opinion this is more of an opportunity than a disaster (I'd still rather be in Tyrolia where I'm *supposed* to be) - I can bounce you in Mars to help keep you in Burgundy, or if you tell me to eff off, I can move back up to Tyrolia",False,True,0

82,12,1903,Fall,france,italy,"How are you holding up? It looks bad initially, but Austria will need to disband a lot in Fall because of Turkey's stab. Not sure how you will come out of it though. Do you need help in fending off Turkey?",True,True,1

I wouldn't mind being the mover into Munich, though.",False,True,-1

95,12,1904,Fall,france,italy,"I'm sure you expect that I'm coming to attack you and, indeed, Turkey is trying to set me up against you. But the way I look at it is that if we were to split your CP, Turkey would still win. I can't let that happen",True,True,2

101,12,1905,Spring,france,italy,I'm hoping to get to Mun this round. if you could support Ruh into Mun that would be appreciated. I can support Tyr in turn,True,True,2

109,12,1901,Spring,germany,austria,"I haven't heard back from anyone else yet, so I'm assuming it's going to develop the normal way (me and France fighting in the west while you and Russia fight in the east). It's critical for us to work together so we aren't steamrolled by either France-England or Russia-Turkey, so do you want to agree to an alliance right off the bat?",True,True,0
110,12,1901,Spring,austria,germany,"Absolutely. One of my favorite things about this game is that it can reflect real life history in certain grander strategic considerations, one of which is that, just as would have been the case, neither Germany nor Austria benefits from an antagonistic relationship.",True,True,0
111,12,1901,Fall,germany,austria,"So given the first move, I think the two of us are in a relatively strong position. Turkey seems to be focusing more on Russia than you, and England and France are fighting. Are you going to focus more on Russia or Turkey first? I could try and stop Russia from taking Scandinavia unopposed, but I'd need assurance first that you're going to put pressure on them from the south since a move like Warsaw --> Silesia would screw both of us.",True,True,0

122,12,1901,Spring,germany,england,"Hello. I don't have much to go off yet since no orders have been placed, but I'm hoping we can work together during this game.

Let me know your thoughts",True,True,0

I'm assuming you're going to build a fleet in Brest, and if you do so and move Bre --> Eng in the spring it would cut any support that fleet could provide and I can kick England out of the North Sea.

314,12,1901,Winter,turkey,russia,"So here’s a plan, given we have to change things a little, and requires less of your time: Italy and Austria are at war, but E/G are working together, so we pivot this into a loosely coupled RAT alliance: Austria and I head against Italy, and you make sure to hold off the north, and Austria will help if Germany comes on land as well (I don’t think they will: France is hard enough, and Germany taking on France and Russia at the same time has... a lot of poor historical precedent).  I’ll see if I can take Rum and let you grab Sev back so you can build north, but we’ll come up with something!",True,True,2

318,12,1902,Spring,turkey,russia,"Ok, I'm moving down to Rum, so you should go GoB-StP, Ukr-Mos and either hang tight with War, or really lock down StP by doing War-Lvn.  If you were playing more heavily, I'd suggest the opposite: tell England you'll not even contest StP if they take it with a fleet instead of an army, and instead throw all your armies at Germany, or go with me into eating Austria.  But that requires actually convincing England to go for it, and you don't got time for that shit right now.

I suggest offering the support, but telling him you’ll naturally have to cover StP in case he’s lying.  Then the safe bet is Lvn covers StP (no northern fleet build 😦 ), and build A War.

331,12,1902,Fall,turkey,russia,"Well if you think this build is likely, you could save Sev for next year: self bounce Lvn and Mos in StP, and take Swe with GoB, and build a northern fleet - maybe South Coast to not piss off England.

619,12,1907,Winter,turkey,russia,"It’ll still probably end up that way, frankly.   Just seeing England roll over like a sick jellyfish and France continue to hold me off while crumbling to you... I figured worst case scenario: you still kill the entire west, I rule the east.  You realize you’re *still* closer to Gibraltar than I am!  So yeah, I didn’t think you were *planning* to screw me, I just looked at the map and saw: what if England and France just *gave him* the win?  Can’t I just cover my ass so even if he grows by 4 next year, I’m still ok?  And seriously: watch how it goes: even with this move, there is nothing I or they can do to stop you from crushing that whole side of the board.  And in 3 full game years?

But it the map doesn’t change: you already have complete domination over the west on your own, and I am not jealous- you did awesome.  I’m just trying to play a little catch up, since France opted to just slow me down and let you have England, instead of take them out and risk me catching the unawares.  Totally in their right, of course.",True,True,2

705,12,1908,Spring,russia,france,Nah. I think the only one of my original supply centers I can save is StP,True,True,4
706,12,1908,Spring,russia,france,I think we have to put England to bed quickly so we can turn all our sights on Turkey.,True,True,4

719,12,1908,Spring,russia,france,I’m more worried about the fleet than the army,True,True,4
720,12,1908,Spring,russia,france,I think one rouge English fleet could be a hastle whereas the army is trapped on the mainland and will probably get disbanded anyway,True,True,4
721,12,1908,Spring,russia,france,I also think we need to go on the offensive in the balkans before he gets more builds,True,True,4
722,12,1908,Spring,russia,france,I can support Pie to Tyr which should break his line,NOANNOTATION,True,4

1301,4,1902,Winter,france,italy,We should talk about moves. I think it's vital that we work together against Turkey and so I'm hoping I might be able to help you with my fleet,NOANNOTATION,True,1
1302,4,1902,Winter,france,italy,I would love to see you inTyrolia again. I'm trying to take Munich back,NOANNOTATION,True,1
1303,4,1903,Spring,france,italy,We should definitely talk since Turkey just built a second fleet,True,True,1
1304,4,1903,Spring,france,italy,"It would be a good idea I think to take the Adriatic and the Ionian, and I can be a third fleet to help you keep the Ionian.",True,True,1
1305,4,1903,Spring,france,italy,"I'm extremely worried about an Austria-Turkey alliance dominating the board, and a Turkey solo resulting from it. Adriatic will keep Venice safe for a very long time and also serve as a way to defend the Ionian. My fleet can also help with the defense if you so request.",True,True,1
1306,4,1903,Spring,italy,france,"Agree - Trying to figure out how deep Austria's alliance runs. Think Turkey will have to swallow it sooner than later, so hoping to turn them to help contain",True,True,-1

1308,4,1903,Fall,france,italy,It looks like Austria was already trying to get into position to attack you since you bounced with them in the Adriatic Sea,NOANNOTATION,True,1
1309,4,1903,Fall,france,italy,Hmm. I wonder if it makes sense to support Ionian to hold this time since Turkey is in the Eastern Mediterranean. Austria might be worried about Venice-Trieste and not go to the Adriatic again,NOANNOTATION,True,1
1310,4,1903,Fall,france,italy,If you think that Turkey will stab Austria you could also ask him to support your convoy into Greeve,NOANNOTATION,True,1

1316,4,1903,Fall,france,italy,"If I were you, I would retreat to Apulia",NOANNOTATION,False,1
1317,4,1903,Fall,france,italy,This is the only way to prevent Austria from taking the Adriatic for free. It also lets me help you with my fleet if you move Tyrhenian to Naples and my fleet moves to the Tyrhenian,NOANNOTATION,True,1
1318,4,1903,Fall,france,italy,"Anyway, we're still in a great place due to some lucky guesses by Russia and Germany NMRing, so I'm going to help you as much as I can. Just ask.",NOANNOTATION,True,1
1319,4,1903,Fall,france,italy,Would you be ok with me building an army in Marseilles? This would give me the option of moving to Piedmont with the goal of taking Tyrolia and helping you attack Austria,NOANNOTATION,True,1

1335,4,1905,Fall,france,italy,Vienna is open if you move there,NOANNOTATION,True,7
1336,4,1905,Fall,france,italy,I totally understand if you do- but I hope you don't bounce me out of the Tyrhenian Sea again so that I can counter Turkey,NOANNOTATION,False,7

1346,4,1901,Fall,germany,austria,Ohhhh haha no I'm not looking to move on you. I moved all my troops that opposite way. I think it's genuinely good for you (especially with Italy starting a Lepanto) and if Russia is busy it frees me up in the west. You see what I'm saying?,True,True,0

1439,4,1902,Fall,germany,england,Alright can we renegotiate? I'm not sure what France said to sway you. Was it the three initial builds? Cuz you can have Belgium. I'd just really prefer to knock out France. Belgium brest and Portugal can be yours. All I want is Paris and Italy can take Marseilles and Spain. Really we can really negotiate however I'd just rather not be at odds w you. Now I'd figure you'd much rather ally w me seeing as France has struck a deal w every nation I've talked to so far which makes him not that trustworthy and he has three fleets that can easily slip in your back door to my one that you have pinned on land...

1444,4,1902,Fall,germany,england,I'm saying honestly both cuz it's by far the most logical thing to do and he's in great position to do it now that he's advanced and you've completely backed off and cuz it's literally what he told me he was going to do,True,True,1

1449,4,1902,Fall,england,germany,Sorry about the delay. I'm willing to exchange Belgium for cooperation against France.,True,False,-1
1450,4,1902,Fall,germany,england,Alright sounds good,True,False,1
1451,4,1902,Fall,england,germany,How should I move? I don't know how to handle his fleets,True,True,-1
1452,4,1902,Fall,germany,england,Well moving out of the channel seriously set you back,NOANNOTATION,True,1
1453,4,1902,Fall,germany,england,But we can fix this,NOANNOTATION,False,1
1454,4,1902,Fall,germany,england,"If you move to the north Atlantic, English Channel and North sea and your army to Wales you can cover your back side and set up a convoy route into France",True,True,1
1455,4,1902,Fall,germany,england,How's that sound,True,True,1
1456,4,1902,Fall,england,germany,"I am not gonna go Nor Atl bcause I want a fleet in Nor, but the rest sounds good. France wants to move into Picardy this turn",True,True,-1
1457,4,1902,Fall,england,germany,"Also given how weird the western triangle has been, can I ask what you're going to do with your fleet? turning to face france leaves me vulnerable in that regard",True,True,-1
1458,4,1903,Spring,germany,england,Oh I honestly don't know yet,True,True,1
1459,4,1903,Spring,germany,england,But I start the game w it and built two armies so I'm not exactly looking for naval dominance,True,True,1
1460,4,1901,Spring,germany,turkey,"We might have some space between us now, but it won't be long until we're on each other's door steps. You want to hash out a long term plan for cooperation?",True,True,0
1461,4,1901,Spring,turkey,germany,Hello and thanks for your message! I am certainly interested in your ideas on this. Have you heard from Italy or Austria at all yet?,True,True,0
1462,4,1901,Spring,germany,turkey,Not yet. Have you?,True,True,0
1463,4,1901,Spring,turkey,germany,Nothing yet either.,True,True,0
1464,4,1901,Spring,germany,turkey,Alright keep me updated,True,True,0
1465,4,1901,Spring,turkey,germany,I think Russia is committing south. Do you plan to bounce him out of Sweden?,False,True,0
1466,4,1901,Spring,germany,turkey,What makes you say that? And no not likely,True,True,0
1467,4,1901,Spring,turkey,germany,Well he has told me he wants to attack Austria. And Austria has told me that he told them that he wanted to attack me. If either of those are true then a 3 unit south start seems likely.,True,True,0
1468,4,1901,Spring,germany,turkey,Hm understood. I think either way it might be in your best interests to jump on Russia. I can't right away but I can come help you later in the game,True,False,0
1469,4,1902,Fall,turkey,germany,"Yeah, I guess you have France to worry about? Otherwise Warsaw would be a pretty easy option for you.",False,True,0
1470,4,1902,Fall,germany,turkey,Yes this much is true. Once I figure out the west thought I think we're in a great situation to collaborate,True,True,0
1471,4,1901,Spring,germany,france,"I'm hoping we can come to a few agreements. Burgundy is a trouble spot for us both. Could we dmz it? I think at the worst, non agression would be in both our best interests, but I'd definitely be open to any proposition you've got",True,False,0
1472,4,1901,Spring,france,germany,"Sorry for the brief message- I'll be available for more negotiation later today. I currently want to support Paris to Burgundy since I am not sure what everyone's plans are yet, and if it looks like we are in good position to work together in the fall I can use Burgundy to take Belgium.",True,True,0
1473,4,1901,Spring,germany,france,No worries. Alright. I understand the move to burgundy but I think it should be obvious that any move into my territory would be met with aggression. Update me in the fall of your intentions?,True,True,0
1474,4,1901,Spring,france,germany,"Thanks. Yeah, it's not that I don't trust you to DMZ Burgundy, but I can't think of a reason not to make the move honestly since it completely protects me against both you and Italy and still leaves room for us to work together. In that sense it leaves me some flexibility to decide my intentions in the fall- the truth is that I currently have no intentions and will let my targets pick themselves.",False,True,0
1475,4,1901,Spring,france,germany,What are your plans in terms of your moves?,True,True,0
1476,4,1901,Spring,germany,france,"It looks like we've already got ourselves a rat. I've heard rumors of Britain looking to attack me. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm sure he's roped you in too. While, on the flipside he keeps trying to convince me to attack you alongside him. I think he wants to pit us against each other and use the opportunity to swoop against either or both of us. I think we should knock him out while we have the opportunity",False,False,0
1477,4,1901,Spring,france,germany,"Yeah, I think you could be right about this. What would this look like? Do you think England will end up taking the Channel?",False,True,0
1478,4,1901,Spring,germany,france,Has he contacted you? And I'm not sure. I don't think he'd be that aggressive right from the start. I can't say I know for sure. What do you want to do?,True,False,0
1479,4,1901,Spring,france,germany,"England did contact me. I might be inclined to take the channel if Russia went to St Petersburg with an army, but at the moment I think it is better to wait and see",True,True,0
1480,4,1901,Spring,france,germany,(wait and see in terms of how to attack England),True,True,0
1481,4,1901,Fall,france,germany,Nice opening moves. Are you going for Belgium? I was planning to head there from Burgundy but it looks like you are in a position to support yourself in anyway.,True,True,0
1482,4,1901,Fall,germany,france,Yeah. Like I said seems England wouldn't be so thoroughly aggressive for a first move. But we should keep an eye out you're right,True,False,0
1483,4,1901,Fall,germany,france,Thank you. Yeah I'd like to take Belgium. I hope there's no issue with that,True,True,0
1484,4,1901,Fall,france,germany,I am concerned over you getting 3 builds and would be a lot more comfortable with that arrangement if you build 2 fleets,True,True,0
1485,4,1901,Fall,germany,france,To be honest I haven't thought about builds. I'll build completely contingent on how everyone around me is postured. If you're not in position and russias not in a position to attack me considering two fleets is a lot more viable,True,False,0
1486,4,1901,Winter,germany,france,Now why would you do that my friend? Bad mistake,True,True,-1
1487,4,1901,Winter,france,germany,"I know it is an aggressive move, and I wanted to tell you about it but I couldn't risk not getting the additional build to put down 2 fleets and attack England",False,False,1
1488,4,1901,Winter,france,germany,I will be withdrawing from Munich immediately if you are willing to help with the assualt- I know what this looks like but I promise you will absolutely love my builds,False,True,1
1489,4,1901,Winter,france,germany,One more point. England proposed a plan to bounce you out of Denmark (but I knew he was lying about it),False,False,1
1490,4,1901,Winter,germany,france,"See you could've gotten those two fleet builds with Portugal and Spain. You don't need the army in Paris unless you want to attack me. If you don't build your army in Paris and only build the fleets, we'll be fine. If you build the army in Paris it's going to mean war",False,False,-1
1491,4,1901,Winter,france,germany,"I can do that for sure, though it does mean slowing down potential convoys into England. What does this look like more broadly? Would you be willing to build a fleet in Kiel to take the North Sea? Does this mean you are letting me keep Munich so I can build a fourth fleet next turn?",True,True,1
1492,4,1901,Winter,france,germany,"Also, we can get creative with my unit in Munich by sending it to Tyrolia to attack and/or help Austria",False,True,1
1493,4,1901,Winter,france,germany,"I want to make this work to the point of potentially waiving a build, so I hope we can figure this out. Completely realistically speaking, I think EG struggles to take out F, and EF or FG has a much easier time just considering the distribution of builds. That's really important in a game that ends in 1910",False,True,1
1494,4,1901,Winter,france,germany,"Another consideration is that England seems like the type of person to switch sides at a moment's notice, and there are some concerns regarding whether they can write orders without a misorder (given their turn 1 misorder)",False,True,1
1495,4,1901,Winter,france,germany,"I think that The best way to do that is for you to build F Kiel and A Berlin, which I realize is a tough sell, but if we do that we can have 5 fleets on England's 3 and quickly roll over him",False,True,1
1496,4,1901,Winter,france,germany,No response?,True,True,1
1497,4,1902,Spring,france,germany,I couldn't waive a build without hearing anything back from you,True,True,1
1498,4,1902,Spring,france,germany,It was written and I then changed my orders,False,True,1
1499,4,1902,Spring,germany,france,Yeah sorry thought I responded,False,True,-1
1500,4,1902,Spring,germany,france,I can't really do a fleet build,True,True,-1
1501,4,1902,Spring,germany,france,You understand,True,True,-1
1502,4,1902,Spring,germany,france,I think we could work together but I definitely need you out of Munich and back to burgundy and then out of burgundy from there,False,False,-1
1503,4,1902,Spring,germany,france,So let's work something out. What's the game plan?,False,True,-1
1504,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,Why do you seem so determined to go after me? I have you at a stalemate that only England can break meaning he'll reap the rewards and Italy and England are both poorly defended. I honestly just want to know the strategic motivation behind it. Legitimate question. I'm curious what you see that I don't...,True,True,-1
1505,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,"I'll send Brest to English Channel and MAO to Irish Sea, but I need Belgium so that I don't go down a build.",False,False,1
1506,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,"In regards to your question, wouldn't you agree that it is not me, but you who are committed towards attacking me? You built two armies and tried to take Picardy. Not saying we can't recover from that- but you left yourself no option to attack or defend against England. Whereas my 2 fleet builds can be used against England and are in position to do so.",False,True,1
1507,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,Cuz you did what I thought you were gonna do. I don't want you taking Belgium and I need you out of ruhr which is one of the places I thought you'd go and is kinda an aggressive move. Now I'm not super interested in giving up Belgium to be honest but I'm not an unreasonable man. Let's negotiate.,True,True,-1
1508,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,"At the end of the day I need a dot, whether that's Munich or Belgium or something else. In return I'd push fleets into Irish, English, and MAO, which sets up a convoy into Wales. And I might try to persuade Russia to help you keep Denmark.",True,False,1
1509,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,On your end you should probably take the Helgoland Blight while you still can. That will make it especially hard for England to keep attacking you,False,True,1
1510,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,"If the English fleet gets into Denmark and you aren't in the Helgoland, it becomes super easy for England to support themselves into hel and then convoy to Kiel,Holland,Belgium, etc.",False,True,1
1511,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,But if you are in the Helgoland all of a sudden they have to support Denmark to hol,False,True,1
1512,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,"""hold",False,True,1
1513,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,Alright I'll think about the move set and get back to you in the morning,True,False,-1
1514,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,I don't see why you need a dot,True,False,-1
1515,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,Just disband the troop in ruhr. That would have us certainly on peaceful terms,True,False,-1
1516,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,"Because you're asking me to use 3 fleets, 1 army (for a convoy), and lose a unit to attack England. When you've been super aggressive towards me with your builds and moves. I'm not going to attack England if you aren't willing to make any consessions.",True,True,1
1517,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,OK I understand what you're saying. I'll think of something amicable for us both when I wake up fr,True,True,-1
1518,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,Did you think of anything? Just curious.,True,True,1
1519,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,Oh sorry. I've been real busy,True,False,-1
1520,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,Hold on,False,True,-1
1521,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,I mean. One thought is to have me take Belgium this year and for me to give it to you back next year. That way you can build a fleet and I would be out of Ruhr as well (Ruhr to Belgium). And I'd use Belgium to convoy out,True,True,1
1522,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,You still there?,True,True,1
1523,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,Sorry,False,True,-1
1524,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,Yes,False,True,-1
1525,4,1902,Fall,france,germany,No need to apologise. I get that you are busy for labor day weekend. Just know that I need a real response before the deadline is over if you are serious about actually working things out. I'll be around for the entire rest of the day.,True,True,1
1526,4,1902,Fall,germany,france,I think that should be agreeable. Let me look at the map again,True,True,-1
1527,4,1902,Winter,france,germany,Seems like you've lost interest in this game? I'd be upset if you weren't talking to me. But the truth is you aren't talking to anyone.,True,True,0
1528,4,1902,Winter,france,germany,If you've lost interest in the game you'll still get paid as long as you put in orders or until you get eliminated. I'd be happy to help you with either of those 🤣🤣🤣,True,True,0
1529,4,1902,Winter,france,germany,If you've lost interest in the game you'll still get paid as long as you put in orders or until you get eliminated. I'd be happy to help you with either of those 🤣🤣🤣,True,True,0
1530,4,1902,Winter,france,germany,The west (you me England) needs to figure our shit out before the East comes and rapes us,True,True,0
1531,4,1903,Spring,germany,france,Yeah I agree,False,True,0
1532,4,1903,Spring,germany,france,Sorry I haven't lost interest in the game it's just not on conspiracy so I don't think to periodically check this all,True,True,0
1533,4,1903,Spring,germany,france,And the moves that got entered were from days ago,False,True,0
1534,4,1903,Spring,germany,france,So let's work something out. I'd love for us to stop all the infighting and make an efg happen,True,True,0
1535,4,1903,Spring,germany,france,That's what I wanted from the getgo,False,True,0
1536,4,1903,Spring,germany,france,Juggernauts coming though and regardless of if you are got buffer or not if you let that buffer go down in me and England it'll steam roll you just the same,True,True,0
1537,4,1903,Spring,france,germany,I'm thinking you want to move to Tyrolia and support Ruhr to Munich while I swing my fleets back south,False,False,0
1538,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,"Ouch, England got you good.",True,True,0
1539,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,I can help you,False,False,0
1540,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,"You still around? If you don't make a very specific move you will lose 4 supply centers this year. No matter what, you will be losing at least 2 supply centers. It's up to you how much you actually want to stay in the game.",True,True,0
1541,4,1903,Fall,germany,france,How would like to work together though?,True,True,0
1542,4,1903,Fall,germany,france,Hold on and I'll respond more in full,True,True,0
1543,4,1903,Fall,germany,france,Yeah I'm still here,True,True,0
1544,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,"Well, I'm not actually sure what the orders are going to end up being, but what I can tell you are my current moves so that it can help you plan your defense. I'm moving to Ruhr and supporting myself to Belgium (no use in lying about that). So Ruhr's support, whatever it is, will be cut.",NOANNOTATION,False,0
1545,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,I think it is safe to assume that Munich and Holland supports will also be cut,NOANNOTATION,True,0
1546,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,So my recommendation to you if you want to stay in the game would be to use Berlin to support Ruhr to Kiel.,NOANNOTATION,True,0
1547,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,"I tell you this with little risk since if you tell England, he'll simply change the plan to one without this key vulnerability",NOANNOTATION,False,0
1548,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,"Now, you have reason to mistrust me, but the truth is that I have 3 fleets and only 2 armies. I stand to gain the least from continuing to attack you. And my largest concern is a Turkey/Russia or Austria/Turkey alliance, which is where I plan to put my focus. I intend to let England and Russia squabble over your supply centers while I move fleets south to help out Italy",NOANNOTATION,False,0
1549,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,"And with Russia taking Munich, your survival means that we could coordinate to take it back in the case of a Russia/Turkey alliance.",NOANNOTATION,False,0
1550,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,So it looks like you really have given up,NOANNOTATION,True,0
1551,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,"I know things are looking bleak, but if you are willing to entertain me for a bit I have a plan that might keep you alive, and thus get a slice of the $24 pool for survivors.",NOANNOTATION,True,0
1552,4,1903,Fall,france,germany,Just to make sure you see it- the plan would involve you retreating to Tyrolia and capturing an Austrian supply center,NOANNOTATION,True,0

1555,4,1901,Spring,austria,russia,"Hello, Russia! I hope we can both agree that peace between our nation's would be beneficial for the both of us?

I'd like to suggest that in return for letting me into Romania, you will have my support should you wish to expand into Scandinavia",True,True,-1
1556,4,1901,Spring,russia,austria,"Hi Austria! I can definitely agree that peace between our nations would be good for both of us! Unfortunetly I can't agree to letting you have Rumania, as that is basically the back door into Russia. If you do try to take it, then there is going to have to be war between our two great countries. Also I don't see how you could really support me into Scandinavia... But that besides, I think we would both benifit from an alliance against Turkey. What do you think about that?",False,True,1
1557,4,1901,Spring,austria,russia,"In that case, I will keep out of Romania if you do the same, we'll keep it as a DMZ?

I'll admit my promise to help you with Scandinavia was a little optimistic, but do excuse me as I'll blame it on a tad too much Austrian beer.

We should keep an eye on Turkey, but I feel as though an alliance this early on will not leave us in the best of standing with the rest of Europe.",False,True,-1
1558,4,1901,Spring,russia,austria,"If were going to have an alliance, we should aim for blitzing turkey. It's the power triangle; Austria/Turkey/Russia. Only one of them is going to survive very long. Also, what is your relationship with Italy looking like? Just a note: I am willing to work out an agreement of who gets what part of the balkans, but I am taking Romania. It is essentially part of Russia and leaving it as a DMZ just will not do if Turkey goes for the Black Sea",False,True,1

1603,4,1906,Spring,russia,austria,Ok. So what do you want to do?,True,True,6
1604,4,1906,Spring,austria,russia,I figure there's not much we can do to stop him from pushing in the north unless you're able to stop him from getting those SCs yourself. I'm pretty tied up in the South and reckon I'll be out soon enough. We just need to try and stop him slowly eating his way up to 18,True,True,-6
1605,4,1907,Spring,russia,austria,"Hey austria. Long time no see. Sorry for the stab earlier. I think we should try to work together to stop france from winning; if we work together we can stop france from getting 3 more centers, and then we will all win in a 3, 4, or 5 way draw when the game is hard-capped at 1910",True,False,5

1620,4,1901,Spring,turkey,austria,Hey Austria! How's it going? I am hoping we can work together on this one. No point getting into any early conflict which will only serve to help everyone else. How do you like to split up the Balkans?,True,True,0
1621,4,1901,Spring,austria,turkey,Hi Turkey! I fully agree that we should stay peaceful with eachother. How do you like the sound of you getting Greece and Bulgaria and I'll go for Romania and Serbia?,True,True,0
1622,4,1901,Spring,turkey,austria,That sounds good. If we stick together we can get through this early game intact. What's your read on Russia and Italy? Have you heard from them?,True,True,0
1623,4,1901,Spring,austria,turkey,Haven't heard from either of them yet unfortunately,True,True,0
1624,4,1901,Spring,turkey,austria,Ah well our biggest issue is keeping Russia out of Rumania. I will see if they have plans to move most units south. It sounds like they might be.,True,True,0
1625,4,1901,Spring,austria,turkey,"Russia is planning to take you out as soon as possible, and is asking me to help. How do you feel about moving against Russia, as I believe that he will be the biggest threat to the two of us. He is really posturing in his communications with me",False,True,0
1626,4,1901,Spring,turkey,austria,"Sure, that makes sense. Like I said, first thing would be  to keep Russia out of RUM, whether that be by supporting yours or my army in.  Italy is pretty quiet but what I did hear from him was fairly anti Austrian by the way. I believe they are probably pretty tight with Russia, them being natural allies anyway.",True,True,0
1627,4,1901,Spring,turkey,austria,Well I'm getting the same sort of stuff from Russia that you have. They are indicating to me that they will commit south and want to attack you directly with my help. I have told them I'd consider it but know that I am firmly locked in to working together with you. Looks like our neighbours have made the decision for us really which makes it easy right?,True,False,0
1628,4,1901,Spring,austria,turkey,I'm quite happy to support you going into Romania as I can imagine that I'll need my forces to fend off Italy. Will you be moving up to Bulgaria this turn and go onto Romania from there?,False,True,0
1629,4,1901,Spring,turkey,austria,Ok yes let's do that and I can support you into Greece the following year if you don't get it this year.,True,True,0
1630,4,1901,Fall,turkey,austria,Just confirming that you will support my BUL army into Rum this season? Looks like Russia is firmly committed South but Germany is gifting them Sweden and England looks like they wont put up any resistance either so we better not let them take RUM as well or they'll be running rampant in no time.,True,True,0
1631,4,1901,Fall,austria,turkey,"I can confirm that I will definitely be supporting you into Romania.

Russia has been trying to sow doubt between us by telling me that you told him that I plan to attack him",True,True,0
1632,4,1901,Winter,austria,turkey,Nicely done! I reckon we've got Russia on the backfoot now,True,True,-1
1633,4,1901,Winter,turkey,austria,"Yes, nice one. I'm glad we could sort things out. Next is to get you into Greece then we'll have secured our front and can go from there. Russia does have three on RUM but we can fend that off together and Warsaw for you and Moscow for me can be the mid-term goal. What do you think?",True,True,1
1634,4,1902,Spring,austria,turkey,Sounds like a plan. I'll support Rum this turn and move down into Greece,True,True,-1
1635,4,1902,Spring,austria,turkey,"Ah, I didn't see that Italy was in Greece. Would have been wise to check the map before sending messages",True,True,-1

1637,4,1902,Spring,austria,turkey,What do you want me to do in regards to Russia?,True,True,-1
1638,4,1902,Spring,turkey,austria,We can support your bud army into gal. I think that would be best. So I support you into gal and support ser army into Greece. If it works out for spring I mught be able to get a convoy in in fall but that's probably a next year thing.,True,True,1
1639,4,1902,Spring,austria,turkey,"Yeah okay, that works",True,True,-1
1640,4,1902,Spring,turkey,austria,Hmm we might need to change our plans. I think Russia is planning to go to sil anyway. Still on for Greece though. What are you going to do about tri? Can you trust Italy not to go for it?,True,True,1
1641,4,1902,Spring,turkey,austria,Yeah i think best to support you into Greece in the fall. Just need to hold in rum this season. If you can still support me in rum that would be appreciated.,True,True,1
1642,4,1902,Spring,austria,turkey,Roger that,True,True,-1
1643,4,1902,Spring,austria,turkey,I'm not sure if going for Greece this turn is entirely preferable as Italy said they plan to move out and it might be better not to provoke them quite yet,True,True,-1
1644,4,1902,Spring,turkey,austria,Ok good call,True,True,1
1645,4,1902,Fall,turkey,austria,Well looks like Italy messed it up. Anyway thanks for the support. Looks like I did need it after all. What do you want to do this season?,True,True,1
1646,4,1902,Fall,austria,turkey,"Now Italy has moved into Tyr, which we agreed was a DMZ so if you could support Ser in Greece that'd be much appreciated. What do you want to do Vis a vis Russia?",True,True,-1
1647,4,1902,Fall,turkey,austria,"No problem, I will support you into Greece. If you can attack gal to cut the support there and support me in rum that would be great. All going well we get one each. Do you think Italy will be getting out of Greece though anyway?",True,True,1
1648,4,1902,Fall,turkey,austria,"Actually don't worry about supporting in rum, just the hit on gal should do it.",True,True,1
1649,4,1902,Fall,turkey,austria,Just confirming that you still need my support into Greece? And can still hit gal for me?,True,True,1
1650,4,1902,Fall,austria,turkey,Yes for both,False,True,-1
1651,4,1902,Fall,turkey,austria,Italy claims to be moving out of Greece. I might need to pull the support. I'm being told that you and Russia might be attacking me instead 😟,True,False,1
1652,4,1902,Fall,turkey,austria,Meh I'll trust you over them. Ill keep the support locked in. If you and Russia wanted to take rum you could do it. Then we would be bogged down for the foreseeable future and that would just help the West. We have the jump on the west at this point so I'll hope you're still on board for that reason.,NOANNOTATION,True,1
1653,4,1902,Fall,austria,turkey,Russia and I haven't been in contact since I first betrayed him. May I ask who told you this?,True,True,-1
1654,4,1902,Fall,turkey,austria,Italy was suggesting it more than saying it but they got me a bit paranoid anyway,True,False,1
1655,4,1902,Fall,austria,turkey,Now there's something. Italy was suggesting that he and I go against you,True,True,-1
1656,4,1902,Fall,turkey,austria,Yeah I'm not surprised. He was also offering me support into Serbia. We can stick to our guns here and easily take Russia and Italy. Ive got the paranoia in check now.,True,True,1
1657,4,1902,Fall,austria,turkey,"Aye, Russia was also asking me to turn on you but we've got a good thing going here",True,True,-1
1658,4,1902,Winter,austria,turkey,"Russia has asked me to work with him and Italy (don't know for sure that they are in cahoots yet), and suggested that he support me into Romania and Italy into Bulgaria. This is of course, not possible now that Italy had retreated from Greece.

I was wondering perhaps if I should string Russia along, so that we may know his moves?",True,True,-1
1659,4,1902,Winter,turkey,austria,You could definitely do that if you like. We will know more once we see where Russia builds,True,True,1
1660,4,1902,Winter,turkey,austria,I suspect Italy and Russia would be working together at least at some level. They are obvious allies. We have the jump on both of them now though,True,True,1
1661,4,1903,Spring,turkey,austria,"So I was thinking I would push into UKR this year and then MOS. Depending on how things go, I can support you into WAR and go for MOS next year.

What do you think?",True,True,1
1662,4,1903,Spring,austria,turkey,"Done and done. Supporting RUM - UKR, Disrupting BOH and hopefully taking ADR",True,True,-1
1663,4,1903,Fall,turkey,austria,What do you want to do for this one? We should probably repeat our fleet moves. This time we would get one or the other,True,True,1

1665,4,1903,Fall,turkey,austria,Ok have locked that in,True,True,1
1666,4,1903,Fall,turkey,austria,Might need to shift tack a little bit. Would love to break through into Russia but maybe we need to make ground into Italy first?,True,True,1
1667,4,1903,Winter,austria,turkey,"Aye, we seem to be in a bit of a stalemate at the moment",True,True,-1
1668,4,1903,Winter,turkey,austria,Ill come in to the ADR so don't go there with your fleet. Also I will support your army in GAL to UKR - that might get us somewhere. But I guess we will have a new army in WAR to worry about. Will check again after the builds.,True,True,1

1671,4,1904,Fall,austria,turkey,It has gotten rather back and forth,True,True,-1
1672,4,1905,Spring,turkey,austria,Well you've given up your best ally for... well... nothing? Are you going to follow through as Russia's Puppet?,True,True,0

1674,4,1905,Spring,turkey,austria,"Yeah I get that. If you can convince Russia to worry about the main threat - France. Call a truce and you and I can both try and hold France back. If not, I will obviously just help France take it out for the price of my survival. I don't really mind either way",True,True,0

1699,4,1902,Spring,france,austria,So. What exactly is going on in your region? It looked like you and Turkey were buddies but those Turkish builds aren't that ideal for you I think.,True,True,2

1968,4,1903,Fall,turkey,russia,"Sev is too dangerous because Sev to Arm together with your ally Italy by sea and its basically and I just lost Austria as an ally. In the short-term then you have 3 to attack RUM with. Also, you think I can hold off you, Italy and Austria at the same time? I don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as you're suggesting. Also, why would I be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally Italy to come back at me by sea. And I don't know where you get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then you're really going to support me into RUM in the fall *as well* as the 2 I got from Austria? So you get 1 and I get 3, that's really the deal you're happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but we both know you have no intention of supporting me into RUM in the Fall.

1969,4,1904,Spring,russia,turkey,"Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.",True,False,0
1970,4,1904,Spring,russia,turkey,"If what you say about you and Austria not having an alliance anymore is true, then it looks like you don't have any friends at all close to you.

For now we might not have to much to do with eachother, but I would love to have an alliance with you! How is it looking in the north? Are you thinking of teaming up with England or germany? I would recommend england as an ally, as I have heard rumours of germany trying to takey you out. Looking forwards to a great game!

2058,4,1901,Spring,france,russia,Sounds great! I took your advice and am working things out with England. Hopefully we can keep things balanced between them and meet up somewhere in the middle.,True,True,-1
2059,4,1901,Spring,france,russia,Them being England and Germany,True,True,-1
2060,4,1901,Spring,france,russia,Any thoughts on your south? A Russia/Turkey alliance could work well since I think that Austria and Italy may be fighting early on.,True,True,-1

2063,4,1901,Fall,russia,france,Hmm. Are you still allied with England? They did a pretty anti - Russian move there.,True,True,1
2064,4,1901,Fall,france,russia,I think England's moves might actually lean more pro Russia given that the army move failed and England will have to put a fleet in Norway. An army in Norway would be a lot more anti-Russian for sure.,True,True,-1
2065,4,1901,Fall,france,russia,That being said I am trying to see if England would be interested in making some anti-German moves which can help get England off of your back,True,True,-1

2073,4,1901,Winter,russia,france,Yeah,True,True,-1
2074,4,1901,Winter,france,russia,I wonder if attacking Turkey with Austria is still on the table given Italy's position to help with Bulgaria and/or Rumania. Italy has a highly vested interest in seeing you do well too.,True,True,1

I figure that cutting Rumania support is the best chance you have of keeping Sev, though Turkey has it guaranteed if they simply cut Ukraine support.",True,True,1

2088,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,What about you? Got any intel?,True,True,-1
2089,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,"I would love to work together with Austria, as I think it would be a very powerful alliance. But I fear I can't stop turkey and Austria from continuing to attack me. Also I'm a little worried about England 😰.",True,True,-1
2090,4,1902,Fall,france,russia,Hmm. I was under the impression that England would attack Denmark and that he wanted you to support him into Denmark.,True,True,1
2091,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,Yes. But did you request that?,True,True,-1
2092,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,Sorry mistyped above. I meant England moving into denmark.,True,True,-1
2093,4,1902,Fall,france,russia,"Well, I assumed England would do it anyway because it should be a guaranteed supply center. England and I have been talking a lot",NOANNOTATION,True,1
2094,4,1902,Fall,france,russia,"I think if you move to Norway you'll be better off, I didn't ask England to get you to support him I don't think but I did ask England to move to Denmark (otherwise I'd worry what else those fleets are up to)",True,True,1
2095,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,"Yes. Me and England are on pretty good terms as well, but I really hope they don't attack me. What do you think the likelihood of that is? I think later in the game an alliance between me, you, and England could be insanly powerful.",True,True,-1

2099,4,1902,Fall,france,russia,Hmm. It's honestly really tough to read England. I don't think they are going after you but they did mention taking Sweden earlier int he game so I might request a bounce in Norway or something like that,True,True,1
2100,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,So you think I should move to nwy? And do you think I should arrange a bounce or use it to stab. I don't really want to attack England,True,False,-1
2101,4,1902,Fall,france,russia,Hmm. If you don't really want to attack England I would arrange a bounce probably. I don't know what Norwegian Sea is up to but it is probably best if it stays there,NOANNOTATION,True,1

2112,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,Alright. Hopefully in return for support I could have Berlin and you would get the rest of Germany?,True,True,-1
2113,4,1902,Fall,france,russia,"Especially if the three of us work things out, you could drop down to the Baltic Sea and we'd be able to split Germany very quickly",True,True,1

2133,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,Sorry about me moving into Norway. I was pretty worried they would attack me and some things didn’t match up. Also I really needed the build. Now I feel bad cuz they we’re completely honest 😭. Hopefully England will accept my apology and we can continue our alliance?,True,True,-1
2134,4,1902,Fall,france,russia,Honestly the build was worth it I think. Asutria and Turkey are seriously strong together and stopping them will be a lot harder than I first thought,NOANNOTATION,True,1
2135,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,Yes. Thx for understanding.,True,True,-1
2136,4,1902,Fall,russia,france,Turkey is crazy. They try to make a deal with me and they betray every time. Austria won’t respond to my messages. And basically nobody can help me over there. So hopefully I will be able to hold them off and get some extra builds from Germany,True,True,-1

1. Take Holland and North Sea from England this turn. I would bounce Italy out of Munich and you would get a build, presumably a fleet in St Petersburg.
2. We don't attack England since he's been a very reliable ally, and commit fully to the attack on Italy and Turkey.

2369,4,1906,Fall,france,russia,That's a reasonable position to take- I can give you one back for sure. Though maybe it makes more sense to support you to Edinburgh for a similar effect and not having me move to Silesia?,NOANNOTATION,False,3

Considering that both of you are rather powerful with your early builds, I didn't want to overcommit to one side before I knew I could reasonably trust in my own safety.

2456,4,1901,Winter,england,france,"I realize that might be exceptionally frustrating, but hopefully you understand why I might be incredibly cautious with only one build.",True,True,-2
2457,4,1901,Winter,england,france,"That said, I had a lot more to lose in this situation than you. Now that I know I can trust you in our efforts against Germany, I would be more than willing to use my navy to help your cause.",False,True,-2
2458,4,1901,Winter,france,england,"That's great to hear, but I need an actual commitment. I'd like to see you build fleet Edinburgh (or an army). I'd also really like to see English Channel move to the North Sea.",True,True,2

2463,4,1901,Winter,france,england,Any knowledge of German orders/builds? What have they told you,True,True,2
2464,4,1901,Winter,england,france,Nothing super interesting. They want me to go into Brest while they attack. I'll try to find out more for ya,True,True,-2
2465,4,1902,Spring,france,england,"Sounds great. Just as a heads up, Germany has been telling me that he would send his fleet in Holland to North Sea if I withdrew from Munich. Probably a lie, but thought I'd mention it.",True,False,2
2466,4,1902,Spring,france,england,"I'm very close with Russia in terms of our relationship, and I just realized that you and Russia can take Denmark from Germany this turn. Is that something you are interested in? I would definitely ask Russia if they can support you into Denmark in the fall when you are in the North Sea",True,True,2

2473,4,1902,Fall,france,england,"I'm very happy to see your moves. Whild convoying London to Denmark is tempting, I think it makes the most sense to send Skaggerak to Denmark for two reasons.",True,True,2
2474,4,1902,Fall,france,england,"Firstly, Russia is the only thing preventing Turkey and Austria from rapid expansion, which is something we need to prevent in case either of them get in a dominant position in the east to the point of soloing, or being too big to take out in the future.",True,True,2
2475,4,1902,Fall,france,england,"Secondly, a fleet in Denmark can support a fleet from the North Sea into the Helgoland Blight, which is important in case Holland tries to bounce that move. Getting that fleet there is necessary if we hope to take Holland or Kiel in the future.",True,True,2
2476,4,1902,Fall,france,england,"By the way, pretty much everything I've told Germany this turn is a lie. Just so you know",False,True,2
2477,4,1902,Fall,england,france,"Can you move your Brest fleet down south? I'd prefer not to leave my backdoor unlocked, and nothing I have will be able to capitalize on that. That said, I'll be moving into Denmark",True,True,-2
2478,4,1902,Fall,france,england,Are you comfortable if it goes to Picardy again? I want to try and corner Belgium.,True,True,2
2479,4,1902,Fall,england,france,"Germany is insisting that you told him that you'd attack me next, which is concerning since I am a logical target, and it's ""pretty much everything"" is a lie",True,True,-2
2480,4,1902,Fall,england,france,Depends.,True,True,-2
2481,4,1902,Fall,france,england,"Look. You helped me out a ton last turn my moving out of the English Channel and building the fleet in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Germany built 2 armies, used them against me to take a dot from me (I have a disband this turn), and tried to take Picardy. I'm not going to forget that.

I'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the future either. Germany is the largest threat to me right now, and I can't overextend against you without worrying about Italy who has a fleet in Rome (which can only move West).",False,True,2
2482,4,1902,Fall,france,england,"Not to mention. You have a build coming and I have a disband. There's no chance I can win in a fight against you. Germany is trying to show discord between us because he knows it's the only chance he has to survive if we start working together. And for the record, I told him I'd be attacking you right now *if and only if* he gives me Belgium (this is a lie, but I'm hoping that I can snag Belgium this turn). I did not say anything about attacking you after splitting up Germany (and in general I like to deal with the present situation instead of making long-term plans, since the board is constantly changing).

I'll be around to talk more later today, but hopefully that assuaged some of your fears",True,True,2
2483,4,1902,Fall,england,france,"Okay. I will continue to support you against Germany. However, I will only accept Brest into Picardy if MAO moves south. You have other things to worry about, but I'm not going to open up my coasts without an insurance policy. I will move into Denmark, ideally with Russian support, and we can see how the situation progresses from there.",True,True,-2
2484,4,1902,Fall,england,france,"If you maintain our alliance for the duration of the conflict against Germany, I will surrender Belgium and Holland to you as well",True,True,-2
2485,4,1902,Fall,france,england,"I will 100% do that if that is what we want to do. I don't mean to push it too much (as I realize just Picardy is a large trust excersize), but in the interest of full disclosure, I was initially planning to send MAO to the English Channel. I wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily. If you do allow that, you would have control over what we do with that unit- whether that's convoying London to Belgium, cutting Belgium support to try and capture Holland, or sending it to Belgium with supports from Burgundy and Picardy.",True,True,2
2486,4,1902,Fall,england,france,"I can see why you'd want MAO in EC. As a compromise, you can keep MAO where it is instead of moving south, and maybe EC next. Picardy and EC are two big bites, and being able to take them one at a time would go far in my comfort with that move.",True,True,-2
2487,4,1902,Fall,france,england,"Sounds great! Thanks. Let me know if you find out anything about what Germany plans to do (I will do the same, but at this point I don't think he'd share any reliable info with me).",True,True,2
2488,4,1902,Fall,england,france,Lol Germany is mad at me I don't think I'm gonna get much either,False,True,-2
2489,4,1902,Fall,france,england,I can't imagine he is not telling you anything. He has to be telling you something.,True,True,2

2528,4,1902,Winter,france,england,Any ideas on what you want your next steps to be? I don't think Russia stabbed you from malice. If anything I think we'll see with Russias builds that he does not want to get into conflict with you,True,True,1

2540,4,1902,Winter,france,england,Idk it seems like you aren't worried about Turkey/Austria at all.,True,True,1
2541,4,1902,Winter,france,england,"You should be very worried. Think about them as an 11 center power. They're going to roll over Italy and Russia very, very quickly",True,True,1
2542,4,1902,Winter,france,england,"It seems like you are so far away, so you don't have to worry about it. But the truth is that they don't need a single one of your supply centers for one of them to win the game.",True,True,1

2545,4,1902,Winter,france,england,"It's so much easier to stop right now rather than later. Or in fact, instead of stopping it we could just create a stronger counter-alliance",True,True,1
2546,4,1902,Winter,france,england,That's why I want Russia to be as strong as possible right now to stop the AT in their tracks. If you don't want to do that I think we have to hit Germany hard right now. Maybe you can move to the Helgoland and take Norway in the fall?,True,True,1
2547,4,1902,Winter,england,france,"While I reasonably hesitated to involve myself in the conflict with a Germany, the fact that I have taken Denmark (and intend to continue attacking with the fleet in Denmark) ought to indicate that I'm no longer hesitating to commit. While Turkey/Austria is a significant threat in the late game, I'm also concerned with not being eliminated in the short-term. The fact of the matter is that I am surrounded by powers who can stab me with devastating effect (you) or powers who have in fact stabbed me (Russia) or would stab if given the chance (Germany). I am more than willing to hit Germany right now and move South from Denmark, but I also need to cover my bases and get Nor. Russia can have centers in Germany to combat AT.",True,True,-1

2549,4,1902,Winter,france,england,"Very fair, thanks for writing out your thoughts. We'll see what happens but you probably will grow faster than I can. Germany has so many armies that any successful attack on him hinges on you (and Russia to some extent)",True,True,1
2550,4,1902,Winter,england,france,Alright. Where do you want the Danish fleet to move? Has Russia communicated a plan with his armies? I'll communicate to Russia that if I have Norway he can take his picking of German centers to combat AT,True,True,-1
2551,4,1902,Winter,france,england,Makes sense to move it to Kiel I think?,True,True,1
2552,4,1902,Winter,france,england,Yeah I was thinking actually that it would make sense to put Russia into munich,True,True,1

If you sill plan to let Russia keep Norway then I would recommend ordering North Sea-Helgoland Blight, Denmark - Kiel, and Edinburgh-North Sea.

2562,4,1903,Spring,england,france,"I need you tell me whether or not the idea I just had is stupid. If Russia trusts the FER alliance, I could totally convoy army to Livonia and support any of the centers neighboring it. Is that even worth proposing or should it stay in my head?",True,True,-1
2563,4,1903,Spring,england,france,Support Russia defending I mean.,True,True,-1
2564,4,1903,Spring,france,england,It's worth proposing but maybe not at this point since it will take a while to set up anyway. That's a great idea for the future I think,True,True,1
2565,4,1903,Fall,england,france,What's your goal with EC?,True,True,-1
2566,4,1903,Fall,france,england,Literally just to take Belgium- after that it will go south or help you if needed,True,True,1

2678,4,1902,Winter,turkey,france,Sorry for my lack of communication - been busy here. I'm leaning towards a fleet at this stage. I don't have anything on England and Germany - Germany says they are tied up and suggest I go after Russia - both things are not going to enlighten anyone who is looking at the board right now.

2684,4,1903,Fall,france,turkey,"That's the case if you're trying to top the board, but the way we're paid it doesn't matter if you have 17 supply centers or 1",True,True,-1
2685,4,1903,Fall,france,turkey,"It's not a ton of difference in terms of payment honestly. But if you can eliminate somebody without being eliminated yourself, I'd say that you'd be better off (in general)",True,True,-1
2686,4,1903,Fall,turkey,france,I'm in it for the competition and to win.,True,True,1
2687,4,1903,Fall,france,turkey,"But, think about all the things you could buy with $2 Amazon credit 🤣!",True,True,-1
2688,4,1903,Fall,turkey,france,Lol good point! I should reassess my priorities 😬,True,True,1
2689,4,1903,Fall,turkey,france,"Well whats your plans now - North or East? If you want to go East, I'm here.",True,True,1
2690,4,1903,Fall,turkey,france,...to help,True,True,1
2691,4,1903,Fall,france,turkey,I think I might be mostly positioning myself for the future to remain flexible,True,True,-1
2692,4,1904,Spring,france,turkey,"How about you? Are you still committed to playing the slow grind with Austria? I'm sure you are already aware of this, but we do end the game in winter of 1910.",True,True,0
2693,4,1904,Spring,turkey,france,Yup just going to grind it out. Russia wants to get me. That's his sole mission in this game. Attacking Austria isnt going to help defend against them.,False,True,0
2694,4,1904,Fall,france,turkey,Looks like Austria was convinced to work with Russia? I wonder if your plan is to try and make up with Austria or not.,True,True,0
2695,4,1904,Fall,turkey,france,The German NMR gifting the west annd Russia centers and now Englands moves have written this game off in my opinion.,True,True,0
2696,4,1904,Fall,france,turkey,"I get where you are coming from, but I hope you stick it out. I think you've forgotten that your loyal ally France has come to save the day!",True,True,0
2697,4,1905,Spring,france,turkey,"So, what are your plans now? I don't want to fight you over the Ionian",True,True,4
2698,4,1905,Spring,turkey,france,Just going through the motions - happy to do whatever you like really - just let me know,True,True,-4
2699,4,1905,Spring,turkey,france,"However, one thing I would ask is that you hit NAP with ROM. I just want to survive, so I need to keep Austria out of ADR. Otherwise, my units are at your service 🙂 Just don't let Russia win please.",True,True,-4
2700,4,1905,Spring,france,turkey,Sounds good. I will definitely be keeping an eye on Russia,True,True,4
2701,4,1905,Spring,france,turkey,Austria is already in the Adriatic Sea unfortunately though,True,True,4
2702,4,1905,Spring,turkey,france,Sorry I meant the ION,True,True,-4
2703,4,1905,Spring,turkey,france,So do you think I'm allied with Italy or something? You basically have done the opposite to everything I've asked in relation them which is... strange. You'd have had nap now if you followed through.,True,True,-4
2704,4,1905,Spring,france,turkey,"You are obviously not allied with Italy. I don't want you to feel like you are being ignored- but ultimately I decided to make the moves that I thought would be best to help me hold onto what I currently have of Italy. A better way for me to handle things would have been to give you a heads up beforehand (for which I apologize). That being said, we would be having a different conversation had I made an explicit commitment towards moving to Naples. And in terms of results, I think you are actually the greatest beneficiary of the moves from last spring, so there is also that 😂 .",True,False,4
2705,4,1905,Fall,france,turkey,"If you would like, I can support Albania to Trieste",True,True,4
2706,4,1905,Fall,turkey,france,I have to defend Greece but thanks,True,True,-4
2707,4,1905,Winter,france,turkey,Still there?,True,True,6
2708,4,1905,Winter,france,turkey,Nice work on the build by the way.,True,True,6
2709,4,1905,Winter,france,turkey,I agree that you should defend Greece. Any thoughts on what you want to do about your fleet in Tunis though? Maybe we can organize a swap for Naples?,True,True,6
2710,4,1905,Winter,turkey,france,Sounds fair to me,True,True,-6
2711,4,1905,Winter,turkey,france,And btw my message about Greece was sent last season but I forgot to give it the thumbs up so it didn't go through.,True,True,-6
2712,4,1905,Winter,turkey,france,I messed that season up though - had to just let Russia into Sev with his army so he couldn't build there and I could've taken the Black Sea,True,True,-6
2713,4,1906,Spring,france,turkey,Looks like Russia failed to build in Sev anyway 🙂. What's your relationship with Austria?,True,True,6
2714,4,1906,Spring,turkey,france,That is handy. Pretty good overall although he's been quiet lately. He stabbed me but then Russia immediately attacked him so I'm sure we can work something out.,True,True,-6
2715,4,1906,Spring,france,turkey,He's angry at me- so not sure how helpful he will be against Russia. I bet Austria will be taking supply centers from me this turn.,True,False,6
2716,4,1906,Spring,france,turkey,"Nice moves-except for the Austrian hold in Budapest, which means that Rumania was not taken :(",True,True,6
2717,4,1906,Fall,france,turkey,I'm supporting your fleet in Tyrhenian to Naples as per our earlier agreement to swap Tunis for Naples.,True,True,6
2718,4,1906,Fall,france,turkey,Any idea what the deal is regarding Russia/Austria? I imagine that Austria and Russia plan to take a couple dots off of me this turn,True,True,6
2719,4,1906,Fall,france,turkey,"I think the point where I stop making any progress is coming up very soon, so I'd love to start talking about ways this plays out to a draw",True,False,6
2720,4,1906,Fall,france,turkey,thoughts? The bot was down for a short bit,True,True,6
2721,4,1906,Fall,france,turkey,Are you moving to Naples?,True,True,6
2722,4,1906,Fall,turkey,france,"Yes, and thanks for the support into it",True,True,-6
2723,4,1906,Fall,turkey,france,"sorry, been out for a bit",True,True,-6
2724,4,1906,Fall,france,turkey,Sounds good. No worries,True,True,6
2725,4,1906,Fall,france,turkey,"I was floating the idea of a 3 way draw between you, Russia, and I, since it would make sense if we pulled it off correctly.",True,True,6
2726,4,1906,Fall,turkey,france,Up to you guys really. I will probably just try and be a pain for whoever is getting close to the solo by helping the other. I would therefore be happy to take the draw instead.,True,True,-6
2727,4,1906,Fall,turkey,france,Looks like you should be able to take it out anyway though. Russia has been playing some sub-par moves so the solo is there for you to take.,True,True,-6
2728,4,1906,Fall,turkey,france,With the English freebies its pretty much done.,True,True,-6
2729,4,1906,Winter,france,turkey,There's no solo in sight right now,False,False,8
2730,4,1906,Winter,france,turkey,Probably makes sense to build an army for you I would think. We're stalemated in the Mediterranean anyway,False,True,8
2731,4,1906,Winter,france,turkey,I'm building an army in Marseilles for example,False,True,8
2732,4,1907,Spring,turkey,france,What do you mean there's no solo in sight? lol you're on 15 and there are three free centres in England... I might not be paying much attention to this game but I'd have to be blind and dumb not to see that. Even if there weren't freebies there you could get them elsewhere. You'd have to try harder not to solo from here haha,True,True,-8
2733,4,1907,Spring,france,turkey,"Sure, it's definitely possible. That being said, I also think it would be inconvenient to take English supply Centers due to the density of those units",False,True,8
2734,4,1907,Spring,france,turkey,"Regarding the three way, the best way to do it would probably be to force Austria off the map this turn. Maybe Bulgaria-Serbia with support from Rumania while Russia supports Galicia to Budapest?",True,True,8
2735,4,1907,Spring,france,turkey,"The only issue would be a retreat to Greece or Albania, so it might be worthwhile to bounce in Albania with Greece and Ion to prevent any retreats",True,True,8
2736,4,1907,Spring,france,turkey,"Interesting, I didn't mean to take Naples- I figured you might cut the Tyrhenian Sea's support. I'll move out if we can call a truce in Trieste?",True,False,8
2737,4,1907,Spring,france,turkey,Interesting choice to move to Albania as it means that Turkey can retreat to Greece,True,True,8
2738,4,1907,Spring,france,turkey,*Austria can retreat to Greece,True,True,8
2739,4,1907,Spring,turkey,france,"This game is over, spending more than 2 minutes per season is a waste of time. I'm glad you found the moves interesting though! I cant stop laughing at ""I didn't mean to take Naples"". In my experience, the best way not to take something is to not attack it. That's just what I've found but I guess you've got other methods of not taking something haha, of course you meant to take Naples and of course we both know that this game has been over for a few seasons. It's all the same at this point. Good game, well played. If you're trying to rack up lies with me I wouldn't bother. I have to conclude that that's the only point for all of them the last few seasons or is it just for fun? If its just for fun, carry on, I dont mind. If its for the successful lie counter, Russia is a better option for that I think?",True,True,-8
2740,4,1907,Spring,france,turkey,"Well. I was trying to get you to not take Trieste in the fall. I can support it to hold, but I suspect that if you and Russia are coordinating, Vienna would cut Tyrolia's support.",False,True,8
