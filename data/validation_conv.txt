Game number 11
----------

Between italy, germany:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Good afternoon to our friends in the south, just sending this message to open a
channel for future relations when ever they need to happen, and to say 'howdy and have a
good game' to you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Of course! I thank you very much. The future of the Kaissereich and its effect on
my neighbors will be very important to me, so tell me if you want help to dissuade attack.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, should the French turn out to be a thorn in my side I would greatly
appreciate the aid

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Greetings from new Italy!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Would just like to reiterate that Italy would likely take an opportunistic stance
towards France - their defensive position is strong enough that I won't attack them
proactively, but if they are locked into a conflict with you I might stab them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So in that sense Italy is broadly friendly to your interests - if you and France
are allied I will leave you alone, but if France is your enemy I could potentially help
you to break a stalemate

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But what I'd need in exchange is for you to keep me posted on developments in the
west. Are you leaning towards working with England, or France?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: It seems for the moment that both are cooperative, but I'm likely to side with
the French from the outset barring difficulties with them. I'll keep you posted, same
relationship as previously established. In any case, friendship with the French is not
very likely to last past England's demise so I'll definitely need the help then. Thank!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Makes sense. Hopefully I'll be on the winning side of a conflict against Turkey or
Austria by then, which should put us in position to squeeze France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'd greatly prefer you end up on Austria's side of that conflict all things
considered, but if things don't go his way I wouldn't blame you for siding against them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Definitely understandable. But since Italy starts off as one of the weaker
countries, I basically need to play a little opportunistically

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: The elephant in the room is Russia - would you have any insight on what they're
planning?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Unfortunately we only talked very briefly about staying out of each other's ways.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Haha didn't try to hold Sweden hostage to get him to play nice with Austria? That's
my usual go-to as Germany lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Have you talked more with Austria? I must admit to being concerned about you moving
to Tyrolia in their defense

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Since that would allow the two of you to launch a pretty credible attack on Venetia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: As Germany I generally play somewhat more careful, get them to just promise not
to be an enemy until the Western Triple becomes a Western Double. As far as Austria goes,
we're allied, hence my preference for Turkey being your foe rather than them. I've no
intent of turning South though, not by any means. Don't have the pieces for that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Yeah, fair enough. I'm planning on a pretty standard opening to Ionian Sea, aiming
to convoy to Tunis and with a bounce in Austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: It's a pretty noncommittal move, so will wait and see how things play out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But I'm sure nobody will miss the fact that it sets me up for the Lepanto if the
cards fall that wau

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well the Lepanto setup is generally considered Italy's best opener, regardless of
whether they trust Austria, hard to argue with a classic.


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: It's looking like the Russians and the Turks are trying a Juggernaut.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: If they do that, we desperately need to be strongly allied with the Austrians,
otherwise they'll roll us over, hard.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I am also concerned about the Juggernaut, which pushes me towards you and Austria's
camp

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: It seems France and England are at a loggerhead already, so if you side with
England it might be an opportunity for me as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Our interests are aligned in both sides of the map, so let's just coordinate
closely


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I'd be more comfortable committing both fleets east to support Austria against
Turkey if I knew you were going to Burgundy (which makes it harder for France to convoy to
Tuscany)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: France's F Marseille is a major headache for me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: What say you?


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: France is definitely going to be a thorn in your side, unfortunately I can
neither afford to attack them right now nor likely convince them to not attack you,
they're more powerful than I am and I've already pissed off two of my three potentially
unfriendly neighbors.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The Balkan Front is pretty secure for you two though, you can at least hold and
with some tricky maneuvering, very easily begin advancing through the Turks.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Understood. Know that Austria and Italy are not going to be able to hold out
against Russia and Turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: If you want to prevent a juggernaut, we will need whatever help from you we can get

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, as I'm sure you've noticed, I've mobilized for the task.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I've talked to the French to try and get them off your back, but they're
dedicated to seeing you off. They told me to tell you that they plan to attack Piedmont
with support, which indicates that they're probably planning a convoy to Tuscany. You
can't let that happen.


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Well, it seems the attack on Piedmont with support was genuine, which seems like a
very poor decision by the French

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, maybe they predicted that you'd think they were lying to me? Regardless,
bad move on their part in any case, especially since you have a build.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Good news for you though. A distracted France is still more than enough firepower
to get you through England, and it makes it easy for you to stab them after

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I don't know whether you deliberately leaked me that intel thinking I would
disbelieve it and go to Tuscany, but no hard feeling if so

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: That's jsut well played

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: It certainly does, I wish they'd let you get on with destroying the Turks so you
could focus fire on them when it's needed but still. And I gave you that information
because I genuinely thought that their objective would be to get you to expect what they
told me to tell you so they could do something else. Was worried that they'd do the convoy
because that would be devastating for you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Haha honestly that risk was very top of mind for me, since I attempted the same
convoy as France in the previous game

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So would likely have made the risk averse move to avoid the convoy even without the
warning

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, it's a real power-move as the French to pull off that convoy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Well, it didn't work for me either

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, experienced Italys generally see it coming.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Indeed.


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm trying to do damage control with the Austrians. It was incredibly damaging
for them to do that and I can't imagine why they've decided to side with the Turks rather
than you. If it doesn't work out, I'm going to go nuclear and split them lengthways with
the Turks.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I was taken very surprised in large part because I didn't see - and still don't see
- what they stand to gain

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: And if they really stand to gain ground, why not make a play for Venice?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: No idea, the y apparently aren't interested in working with you anymore. I'm
quite frankly pulling my hair over this, it's the worst possible move.


1903, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I find myself very confused by it as well, which is part of why I am not quite sure
how to respond


1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Would you be willing to coordinate against A Tyrolia? I'd be happy to support A
Munich in

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm afraid that if I do that, my current position could quickly become untenable.
I'm worried that the Austrians are planning something funky.


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright, so, I realize that this is a little bit late, but now that the Austrians
are embroiled with the Turks, I am moving against the French. I'm trying to convince the
Austrians that its in their best interests to join back with you, but I would understand
if you might resent him or both of us for our failure to consistently side with you.


1904, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: You stabbing the French is already a massive lifeline to me. I could not in good
conscious ask you to do more

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I will listen to what Austria has to say, and keep you updated on that front. I do
not really trust them, but I may still be willing to work with them against the Turks if
they say the right things

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm moving on the French this next season, hopefully they'll pull back to face me
and you and the British will be able to surge back against them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I'm pleasantly surprised that you're so willing to work with England as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: In that case i'll play defensively but try to set myself up for a counteroffensive

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well the English are a little miffed that I didn't move last season, but still, I
see no reason not to work with them for the time being.


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Yeah, agreed. The English are too desperate to turn down your support

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Conversely, you have a free walk into Paris right now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Since France has only fleets

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: A Mun - Bur and then to Paris is guarrenteed to succeed as long as you can cover a
potential stab on Mun, which you could easily do with A Ber

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: And then A Hol-Bel isn't quite as foolproof, but is pretty safe as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Especially if you support yourself into NTH and move Kie - Hol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: If you're wondering who convinced the French to make it a fleet, you need go no
further

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Well, sounds like things are in good shape!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hopefully the French are sufficiently distracted that you can launch a counter
attack.


1905, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Yeah, I'll make the most of this


1906, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The Austrians wouldn't happen to be talking about me, would they?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I haven't heard anything from them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, at the very least that's good. I'm worried about them potentially deciding
that they want Warsaw, despite the fact that I'm on the right side of a stalemate line
where they'd only get 1 supply center if they attacked.


1906, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Are you coordinating with the Turks? I think that for the time being that would
be a good idea.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Yeah, am trying to do so

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: Not to be needy or anything, but I would greatly appreciate a hard move for
Venice this next year.


1907, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I will make a play for Venice this Fall

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: If I was in Austria's shoes, I would do a self bounce of F Ven - Tri, A Ser - Tri

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So I plan to do F Alb S F Ven - Tri, A Apu - Ven

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Odds of succeeding in this improve dramatically if also support with A Tyr S A Apu
- Ven - would you be willing to do so?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Gas and Bur likely cannot take Mar anyways, so in my view you would be better off
using: A Par & A Pic S A Gas - Bre F NTH S F Bel - ENG A Bur - Mun

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: This would be a near-guarantee that you take Brest and would occupy F ENG as a
consolation prize in the only outcome where you didn't, while still covering Munich

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: My only problem with that plan is that it risks losing Burgundy if the French
pull a fast one and go for Silesia instead, while moving Marseilles into Burgundy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: That's a valid point. My view is that A Mar - Bur is unlikely but A Boh - Sil is a
real risk

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: If you want to keep France out of Bohemia, A Gal is the only unit you have that can
do so

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Which might be a better investment that using it to try and snipe Bud

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Although actually, if you hit Vienna and France has two disbands, they may struggle
to keep up the pressure around Silesia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: That's true, I don't know if I want to take my chances with that though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'll probably move into Vienna, but I'm not sure I can afford to move out of
Burgundy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Understood, So then you would use A Gal to cover Warsaw, A Bur to cover Munich, and
then try to snipe Vienna with A Tyr?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Correct


Between italy, austria:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: How’s it going Italy?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Relatively well. I'm doing a small concert soon, so kind of nervous, honestly. How
about you?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I'm assuming we can both agree to a nonaggression pact, and that you too were told
to Lepanto the Turks (though I'm not sure if its a good idea)?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: We're the only ones I trust to understand how unlikely a Solo is, and you seem
interested in cooperation, so I'll honestly put all my chips under your bag and defend you
until the end if you're willing to do the same with me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: At the very least, we can give one hell of a ride.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I haven’t been told to do a Lepanto yet, who said that? And yes I would like
peace on our front, I could have a three front war at any time so it would be great if you
and I did not fight. Where would you expand to then?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I will be moving into Ven with Tri (traditional Austrian opening) and fully
understand that you would go Ven to Tri as a response so that we bounce. If you can come
up with a good alternative then I am fine with that but I don’t see one.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I am perfectly comfortable with a Ven-Tri bounce, so no need for further discussion
on that point. Would like to suggest that we demilitarize Tyrolia, at least for year one
as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Would like to get your thoughts on your other moves? Is A Budapest going to Serbia,
and is A Vienna going to Galicia or allowing Russia in?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Okay the bounce sounds good. And I would love to demilitarize Tyr for this year
and we can talk about it again then

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Why do you need my moves?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I think in general it pays to know as much as possible about what everyone is
doing. Even if they lie, it helps you get an early picture on who is trustworthy :p

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But I think the Austria Italy relationship is bigger than that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Austria and Italy are two countries which can easily fall into a mutually
destructive war until they both get eaten by Turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But it's also very hard for us to trust each other, since it's so easy to stab.
That's a big part of what makes these two countries so challenging for a lot of players,
right?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: In that sense, it helps for us to be open with each other. It's a very different
game for me if Russia gets into Galicia early, putting them and Turkey in place to roll
the map, compared to if you and Turkey push Russia out of Rumania in year one

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: In that context, I'm pretty comfortable telling you that I don't plan to get greedy
in year 1 - as long as I can secure Tunisia while keeping a secure defensive position, I'm
happy


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I 100% do not want to fight you. I agree that Austria Italy is a war that often
happens but never really works out for either side. We would just stagnate until russia or
turkey or both took us out.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: On that note I have heard rumors that turkey and Russia are gonna go for a
juggernaut. If that is the case I’d assume you would help me slow them down.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Probably don’t need to point this out but you allying with turkey would
eventually lead to him attacking you unless you stabbed him first

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Definitely agree that, assuming we can trust each other, the Austria-Italy alliance
tends to be more stable than the Austria-Turkey one

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Turkey and Russia bounced in the Black Sea, but that proves little since Juggernaut
allies often go for that anyways

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Russia has committed pretty hard to the south, which is mildly concerning for both
of us. In the event that the Juggernaut materializes however, my sense is that Germany
would also be willing to support us

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I guess for this year, suggest that we do the Ven-Tri bounce again. I would suggest
to keep Turkey out of Greece and use Vienna to defend against Russia.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I will convoy A Apulia to Tunisia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: All sounds good to me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Have you talked to turkey much?


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Not a whole lot. Their move to the Black Sea was news to me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So turkey went back on their deal with me and tried to let russia get rum while
they snuck into Gre. Juggernaut confirmed

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’d like to propose that you and I go full alliance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I'm game for the Lepanto, and it seems Germany is on board as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: What does that look like in practice? Germany builds in Berlin, you in Budapest

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: And then hit Rumania in Spring?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Not positive what I would do yet but something along those lines. You would
definitely build a fleet in Nap and then move ION to EAS


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: France and Turkey are trying to get me to attack you, obviously I will not do
that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: With the build in Marseilles, France's goals are quite transparent

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Turkey will likely bounce me in EAS. Would you be willing to support me into Greece
(via convoy)?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: From there, I can support you into Bulgaria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’m willing to debate it but I had a different view on this turn. I figured he
would bounce you in EAS but what if you went for AEG instead? Unless you’re worried about
over extending yourself due to France. Because I trust you enough at this point to move
Tri to Alb and then we will definitely be able to get Gre in the fall.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Which makes going to AEG/EAS a bit of an overstretch

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: If we can get Germany on board I'd feel a lot more comfortable with committing east

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Sorry, some connection issues on my end so messages sent out of order

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But basically I'm concerned about France's F Marseille, so a little nervous about
committing both fleets east

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But I think having Germany attack France would ease that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So in theory if we could not get germany to attack France, what kind of attack
would you be comfortable with us making

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: In which case convoying onto Greece is the best use of the fleet and army I'd have
available

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Okay I will support that, can you move out of Ven?


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So I am in a slightly sticky situation but I think I can get out of it. If I
support you holding in Gre then would you move that fleet into EAS?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Also Germany and France are allied, however Germany is also willing to help us
out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Let me know what you’re thinking

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Germany and France allying is not ideal for me, but I feel confident in observing
that Turkey and Russia are allied as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So desperate times call for desperate measures - may need to do what needs to be
done to stop the juggernaut

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Would appreciate you helping me to hold in Greece, and we'll need whatever help
from Germany that we can get

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I can still support A Serbia - Buglaria as well, if that helps

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Look at the moves from last turn, turkey tried to support me attacking Russia.
Why do you think they are still allied?


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: To put it simply, I missed that. I find Backstabbr's map interface hard to read,
and didn't see it in the list of orders

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Which I will look at more carefully going forward

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I gotcha, so you are clearly going after Turkey right now but have to deal with
France. What’re you thinking in regards to that whole situation. Because I have to figure
out whether or not I can use turkey as a short term ally vs Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: However I view you as my most important ally which is why I’m asking you about
all this

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I have moved against Turkey, but I am willing to back down to focus on France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: If you would rather coordinate with Turkey against Russia, I'm open to the idea of
a southern triple as Turkey suggested

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I mean turkey knows that you and I are allied so I think that if you attack him
then he will attack me. I don’t really wanna fight him and russia at the same time

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Do you think you can gain supply centers vs France? I get that you need to expand
somewhere


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: What’re you thinking for this season

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I most likely can't gain a supply center this year, but I should be able to gain
ground as long as neither you nor Turkey stab me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: My thinking is that I'll go with the conservative option

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Which is:  F TYS S F Rome - Tus A Tus - Ven

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: And then withdraw F EAS - ION

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Should put me in position to push through WES starting fall while covering all my
bases defeinsively

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That all seems logical

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: What are you thinking? F Alb S A Gre H would be appreciated in my perspective

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: Neither of us have a good reason to stab you, we gotta focus on russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Yeah, naturally. I'm concerned about what Turkey will do once Russia is defeated,
but that's a question for another day

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: I’ll do that, it keeps turkey from snagging Gre

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Do you have Germany on your side as well?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: So am I, I’d expect they go through me before they go through you. That is why I
need you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Turkey has Sev in their pocket, which might open up a path to Moscow

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: For now, he supported me into War which is nice so I will keep working with them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But they might want it for themselves

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That is true

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Makes sense. Keep me posted

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Will do, we gotta take another russia center this year

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Not immediately relevant to us, but I feel like Sweden will be interesting too

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Just because Russia has a good shot at holding it if they can play England and
Germany against each other

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I reached out to england to see what they think about all of this

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: England seems to be a bit pessimistic, which is probably justified facing a France-
Germany coalition

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Although the fact that France is quite committed in the south and Germany in the
east improves their position a lot

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So, about this whole Greece affair

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
austria: Understandably you would be mad at me about it. I honestly just felt like I could
use it better than you could.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
austria: I realize that sounds rude


1903, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: At least you have that much self-awareness. We opened this game stating that
conflict between Italy and Austria is usually self-defeating, but it is hard for us to
trust each other

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Now that you have betrayed that trust, I don't really see a path forward away from
that mutually destructive conflict

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Understandable


1904, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So, you are now in conflict with all three of your allies

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: All three of your neighbors

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: France may defeat me, but most likely you wouldn't see any centers from that, and
you won't win against Turkey and Germany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I don't trust you enough to seek an alliance, but wouldn't  a ceasefire be mutually
beneficial?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Both of us have our backs against the wall

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yes a cease fire sounds perfect, I need to handle Turkey.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I understand why you don’t trust me, however notice that I have not helped France
and don’t actually want to see you off the board


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Of course a cease fire is mutually beneficial enough that I'd have little doubts

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But that said, if you want to win back my trust, supporting me into Venice would be
a great start

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: With: A Vie - Tyr F Tri S A Rom-Ven

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I would be guarrenteed to take it, with no sc downside risk to you


1906, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So, about your move to the Ionian?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Turkey refuses to work with me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Well, that's good news for me, if you don't mind me saying so

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Lol yeah I know


1907, Fall:
----

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Not sure if now is the right time for "told you sos", but my statement that Italy-
Austria conflict would ultimately lead to both of us going down seems pretty on the mark
right now

at winning

pick your partners well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So,, this is the point in the game where you probably need to start thinking about
your goals

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: If your goal is to survive, you would be best placed in going into Moscow and then
slipping into Scandinavia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Germany has pivoted strongly west, so they would not easily retake it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: And a draw would likely be Germany plus whatever opposing alliance - occupying
German territory would make you a key part of that draw alliance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: If you can capture St Petersburg from Germany while holding on to Moscow

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: And that enables us to stalemate against Germany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: We can include you as one of the survivors in the draw

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

accept

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: Greetings, Russia, this is the new Italy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: This will sound like flattery, but I feel like Russia is the one country Italy
cannot offend. An Italy/Turkey alliance cannot defeat Russia and Austria, and similarly
Italy and Austria cannot defeat Russia and Turkey unless Germany joins as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: So rather than deciding whether I want to attack Austria or Turkey, I'd want to
Target the same one as you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: Attacking France early is a fool's errand

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Oh shucks, so much flattery right out of the gate.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: It's pretty neutral with both so far - perhaps you're leaning one way right now?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: Hahaha Italy is one of the weaker powers on the board. I need to be proactive in
seeking allies, even if it means accepting being the junior partner. And Russia is the
natural first choice

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: Between Austria and Turkey, I haven't had a lot of time to talk to either yet so
don't have a clear sense on who would make a better ally

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Italy typically wants to involve itself more on the Eastern triangle, but it still
borders both

the third, I will help the two of you for a center or two, but otherwise I won't get
involved

italy: Pretty good, just finished Volunteering with some (physically) disabled kiddos,
absolutely unprepared for the mountain of homework I'm somehow staying on top of. What Con
was it?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It was “Whose Turn is it Anyway?” in Durham.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think Turkey and Italy can work together as long as Turkey doesn’t build a lot
of fleets. I would like to not have to build a lot of fleets. Are you comfortable not
putting fleet pressure on me? It frees you up for other things ... maybe an early go
against France or an Austrian sandwich?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: A. Seems like it was great!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: B. I'm fine if you don't want to build fleets. It would be interesting (and
powerful for you) if we had a infantry-naval power dynamic, but I understand if thats
uncomfortable to you. I was planning on going all out with Naval Power, but I think our
alliance could be really important depending on how things swing, so I'll accept cutting
back.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Greetings from new Italy. Also was scanning the previous messages and noticed you
were in Durham.. is that Durham England or Durham NC?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But yeah I am largely aligned with the previous player's view that Turkey and Italy
can make for a great alliance as long as Turkey is more army focused

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

italy: But yeah, game-wise I aim to be pretty defensive year one. If I secure Tunisia, I'm
happy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Austria has been really cagey with me, which probably means they have a plan and
I'm not a part of it. Might be good news for you, or might not, depending on whether
you've reached an understanding with them or not

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

armies north as Italy, everyone wants to talk to me in Fall '01, that's for sure.

turkey: Durham is amazing. The city has really gone through a transformation! Have you

with serious players

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

say as well

a peace in the mediterranean?


1902, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

Austria-Russia collaboration isn't good for me, and it probably isn't the best thing for
you in the long run.  Thoughts?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Agree that I wouldn't want to see a Russia-Austria collaboration, but not sure if
I'd make too much of it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: After being kept out of Sweden, it's natural for Russia to feel that they need to
invest more in the north

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: Currently, France's fleet Marseille is a big headache for me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But if you're willing to support me into Greece (which would be done by convoy), I
could follow up by occupying Adriatic

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Why don't you convoy into Albania?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I would like to have a build, and Greece seems like the likely target

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm thinking - what do you see as a fair split of Austrian dots between us, if
we're going to work together?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Alright!  I might be asking for some help into Serbia in the fall.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
italy: I would say Trieste, Greece to me, and then Serbia and Budapest  to you. You would
probably pick up Rumania as well in this scenario, but need to see how Russia plays
regarding Vienna

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Let’s do this!


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It's come to my understanding that you had no intention of turning on Austria this
Fall.  If you're not motivated to attack him, and I understand why you'd prefer not to go
to war with your neighbor when France is playing in your backyard, perhaps the three of us
can work together and try to force a wedge in the Western Triple?  Allow Austria and I to
focus on Russia and you get into a more threatening posture against France?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: I basically sent this to Austria, I've replaced the pronouns so that it makes
sense to you:   Ok, I now realize that there's no Western Triple.  Instead, it's an FG -
which is just as bad for you guys, since Germany is already into Russia.  Here's my idea,
and take it or leave it ... but I suggest that Italy keep rotating his fleets out (maybe
move towards WES and TUN) while Austria backfills ION.  Italy builds a fleet in ROM and
Austria can convoy Greece into NAP in the Spring.  Now Italy's got three fleets in play
while France is trying to land a unit on England.  Meanwhile, Austria moves the army out
of SER and towards Munich and I move BUL/RUM north into SEV, MOS, and WAR.  It's a logical
expansion for all of us and presents each of us with room to grow and peace in the
Balkans.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: You’re really forcing the fleet build. I wanted to build armies. But you’re
forcing the fleet build.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: I'd like to start by apologizing. The turn change comes first thing in the morning
my time, and your message was sent after I had went to sleep. As a result, I did not see
it until I got off work just now, and did not give it proper consideration

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: My alliance with Austria against you was based on the premise that you and Russia
were planning on a Juggernaut alliance that needs to be stopped as soon as possible, and
that your move to the Black Sea was a concession on Russia's part to grease the wheels of
that alliance.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Your stab on Russia in Bulgaria has proven those premises to be false, yet my move
to EAS puts us in conflict nonetheless

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: For what it's worth, I will build a fleet in Rome as you had requested - as it is
necessary to cover France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: If you are willing to build an army in Con as well, I would take that as a strong
indicator of your desire for cooperation, but would understand if you feel that is not an
option for you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think you need an army in Venice, my friend.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’ll consider the army.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: The army in Venice is more important for my immediate defensive position, but a
fleet in Rome puts me in a better place to slip through WES and attack France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: That being said, if I felt confident that you would allow me to return to ION,
building an army in Venice would be safer

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I think that would be mutually beneficial, seeing as you're probably not a fan of
forcing me to stay in EAS either

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’m gonna roll the dice and build A Con.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: You won't regret it.

and France?  Any thoughts?


1903, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Defensively, I can defend against them easily if they are not coordinated. If they
are, I should be able to hold out for some time but it is ultimately a losing battle

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Of course, that's assuming that you remain neutral in this - if you pick a side in
this conflict, either me or Austria should be able to cruise to victory

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I currently have the upper hand against France and don't face any disbands (since A
Greece disbanded anyways), but a hostile Austria makes it tifficult to commit to gaining
ground against France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: What are your thoughts?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Austria has been a valuable ally for you against Russia and can support you into
Moscow if you were so inclined. But Germany could do the same - their value to you on that
front is reaching its limits

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I wouldn't be able to support you as much from Greece as I was in the past (since
even if I were to somehow reclaim it, it would be with a fleet instead of an army), but I
would still be willing to put pressure on Trieste to help you claim Serbia/Budapest


1904, Spring:

with my fleets.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: On the other hand, I’m not sure I want to attack Austria.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Not sure I'm a fan of you occupying the Ionian

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

Germany has turned on that

right now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I have no choice but to offer myself as the junior partner in a Italy-Turkey
alliance. If you stab me, I will rapidly be conquered by France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

Austria's navy bottled up, and help you break through Austria and on to Germany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: if you cut ADR with ION, you'll get in.  you might even keep Trieste.

which should let me hold Tri

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

Vienna next year

stall Germany's victory for a year

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: The key to not losing to the solo is - assuming the loss of Portugal (which is two
coin flips) - not losing 2 of the 3 Russian centers.  You're going to lose STP.  The
question then becomes, how to we preserve Warsaw?  My recommendation is:  A: VIE S TYR -
BOH A: WAR - UKR A: STP - MOS A: BUD - GAL I: TYR - BOH I: TRI - TYR I: VEN - PIE I: TUS S
VEN - PIE T: SEV - UKR T: RUM S WAR - UKR T: ANK - SEV (Convoy)  This plan destroys UKR or
ensures that we control it.  It places units in places that they can cut supports on
Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or
maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat
to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself
into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow
or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either
keep munich or go after Warsaw.  The other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and
Ukraine.  I'm willing to do as you suggest.

about attacking Russia, because we all know how quickly Russia can run away with the game)
that they we're planning on attacking you. Because I think Italy is a pretty good player
for France to have around, I'm letting you know. I don't know how your relationship with
Austria is, but may I suggest a lepanto? Anyways, good luck and have fun!

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: So... I guess your new? What do you think about this game? The above might still
apply, but I don't know because Turkey might change your mind

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Greetings. I'll talk to Turkey again and see if I think it seems true

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Agree that early fights between France and Italy are often a waste of time for both
sides

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Suggest we demilitarize Piedmont and Gulf of Tyrolia. I won't be too happy if you
move to Spain sc or build a fleet in Piedmont either

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Of course, I don't think we should be fighting(at least this early in the game),
and that it would be mutually unproductive. I agree with a DMZ in Piedmont and Gulf of
Tyrolia, and we might as well extend it to Western Mediterranean and North Africa. But I
hope you understand how unreasonable for you to expect me not to move the Spain, as it is
a typical France acquisition. Also I can't build a fleet in Piedmont... Anyways, Good
luck, and have fun!

italy: Sorry, was in a rush to write these since I just entered the game

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Let me clarify that i have no issue with you moving to Spain - but I'm a bit
uncomfortable with a Fleet in Spain SC

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I believe Spa NC is naturally yours and have no issue with you moving an army there
either.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: As to the Piemdont issue, I actually meant Marseilles

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But yeah, I see that you have made an anti-England opening, so we should get along
swimmingly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yes. Don't worry about a fleet in Spain.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: This stand off in LYO/TYS is a waste of effort for both of us

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: We would mutually benefit from a de-escalation

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: While that might be true, what would you suggest I do with Lyo now? If you have a
good alternative I would be happy to take it, as I'm not super keen on attacking you
anyways

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I can support myself into piedmont and there is nothing stopping me. If you don't
want me to, give me an alternative


1902, Winter:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: It is very poor faith of you to suggest that your hand was forced in your move to
Piedmont. Nobody made you build a F in Marseille which can do nothing but attack me in the
Mediterranean

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: You only managed to get into Piedmont because I was worried that you would attempt
the more creative and threatening move of convoying into Tuscany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Even now, those armies would be far better placed in Gascony, where they are better
placed to convoy to England

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: But to be blunt, I don't trust you enough to see much point in talking with you at
length

elswhere do you want if you concede Venice>

your in, we have to all start working together to stop Germany or they will win.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Seems the game has conspired to make us natural allies once again.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: How’s that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Oh you know, Austria, Germany, it's generally considered suicide to go after each
other.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: And yes I’m always happier as Austria when Germany lets people know that we are
allies

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: You said once again though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Oh well, you were Italy in game 9 yes?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: How’d you figure that out?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, you're the only one that was in both games and both discord channels,
process of elimination.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Gotcha hahaha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Hopefully it isn’t an issue with the study that we figured it out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, they did say that anonymity was optional

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Sounds good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So what’re you seeing from the board so far?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Russia hasn't spoken much, but enough for me to know that they aren't my enemy.
Italy is maintaining friendly terms with me, and the French seem pretty insistent that we
can be allies as well. I think that if all is as it seems, the corner powers, Turks and
English, are the most in trouble at the moment.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: This is of course barring treachery

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’d assume you will be trying to recruit France to go for england then?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: That's the hope, yes

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: This group doesn’t seem very chatty

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Certainly doesn't, might be easier to go outside and squeeze trees for sap.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The Italians are eying you up as a potential enemy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Everything proceeds according to plan thusfar

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Can you do me a favor and bounce russia in Swe since they tried to hit Gal. And
I’ll try to talk to Italy because I don’t really wanna fight them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'll try talking to the Russians first, but if I think they're lying to me or if
they refuse, I'll bounce them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Actually, nevermind. I'm not going to speak with them, I'll just bounce them; you
can count on at least one army coming your direction to help with them after this season.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Looks like they're going to try a Juggernaut, I may have to alter my western
triple plans accordingly.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Ouch, I was going to ask Turkey to support me into Rum for a take or a bounce,
either way it would hold russia from building

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Thanks for the heads up, we will see what turkey says

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, the Russians and Turks seem to have arranged that bounce for the Black Sea
while the Russians maneuvered south. They want us to think that they're not friends until
the moment they start supporting each other around. I'll talk to the Russians and Turks to
see if I can squeeze some info out of them eh?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Sounds good! I’m trying to smooth things out with Italy right now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’ll talk to england and let you know if I hear anything

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The English and I are, for the time being, on good terms, but any wild cards you
could find out for me would be appreciated.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Reached out to France as well so I will let you know. Looks like they might fight
so that will be a fun situation for you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, the Triple's going ideally for me, thank goodness.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Did you actually hear from someone that a Juggernaut is happening or did you just
get that from reading the board

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Just a hunch from reading the board.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Because if I move into Rum thinking turkey will support and they don’t and move
into Gre instead then I am in bad shape.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: But if the move works then Russia doesn’t get a build

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Can you try and approach turkey and get some info, not sure if they’d believe
you’re attempting an attack on me but it could work.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I've done so but they have yet to respond.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Tight lipped, this whole group

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: How frustrating

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Incredibly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah hearing from Turkey that Italy doesn’t love me either so I have to watch out
for that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: He told me not to trust you but I don’t know how you would really attack me so

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Turkey's trying to push you away from those who might come to your aid earnestly,
if he hasn't mentioned Russia then that's more evidence that the two of them are
cooperating.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Makes sense, I’ll probably have to play conservatively

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: God I'm a fucking idiot, ugh. I accidentally sent a message intended for the
English to the French, and the way it's worded makes me look sus as fuck.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Worst case scenario here is that this is literally the turning point where all my
planning goes down the drain and the two, who were about to fuckin' duke it out, turn into
an Entente. Fuck. FUCK.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That’s not good I’m sorry man, england and I just started talking. Anything you
would want me to say/get from him!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: ?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Nothing much, I already got pretty much everything I need out of them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Though if you could unsuspiciously ask them if they have some kind of plan
regarding France or I that'd be very useful.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Ok, so I think the French might just think I'm an idiot now, which is a far
better outcome than I could have possibly hoped for all things considered. If anything
that's better than the status quo before, because they won't think I'm smart enough to
betray them competently.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Russia just confirmed, it's a Juggernaut

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That’s unfortunate

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Thank you for checking on that, I’ll poke around with england

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'll be mobilizing forces East, hopefully the Russians will be too busy with me
to keep the Turks alive.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Hopefully Italy stays with me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: They'd have to be fools not to.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I’ve talked with him a little and he agrees that a strong turkey will
eventually be bad for him

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Good, hopefully he'll maintain that opinion.


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: How'd you swindle the Russians into staying put this time?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I didn’t know they’d do that, never asked them to

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Glad I guessed right on Turkey. He’s still acting like we could be allies, and is
apologizing for not notifying me of his change of plans. He told me that he didn’t support
me into Rum because Russia agreed to bounce in BLA again so I wouldn’t need the support to
bounce. So he’s claiming to be angry at Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: That's a good joke. That basically confirms it though, even if it weren't
already. They're working together.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yes


1902, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Lol especially with that fleet build

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: What’s the situation out West?


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Sorry for not responding, busy weekend, but apparently the British have caught
onto my tricks, the French and I are allied though. The Italians should be able to prove
distracting enough that France won't be able to roll over me once Britain's gone though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: What's the Plan with you? We can effectively guarantee that Warsaw falls, but I
can't hold Sweden, and Vienna is terribly exposed.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Also, either the Russians and Turks are doing a more convincing act than I did
last game, or the Juggernaut has fallen apart.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I didn’t believe that turkey wanted to go against Russia but it looks like
he actually does

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Not sure about my plan I have to look at the board, I will get back to you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I think I will be able to hold all of my supply centers.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Are you gonna support me into Gal in order to guarantee that War falls?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Wouldn't displacing Gal just give the Russians Vienna for free basically?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I meant support Gal into War my bad

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Geez, Ukr into Gal

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Oh my gosh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Ukr into War, final answer

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I was really hoping to secure Warsaw for myself, truth be told, unless you intend
to stay friends with the Turks once Russia's finished off, but then again I'm not under
any specific threat so I suppose you can have it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Do you want both of mine supporting or is one free to maneuver?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: My only reasoning behind you supporting me in is that it guarantees we take it
even if he supports it holding with Gal. They only way for this to 100% work is both of
yours supporting me in

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Because I can’t hit Gal this turn, I have to cover my own ass

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Silesia being the one to move would also render a 100% success rate, that fleet
in Sev can't cut Ukraine and Prissoa isn't under threat

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Prussia*

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: You’re right, rough morning for me apparently. I’ll support you in you’re doing
more of the work

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright, from there Moscow is yours, I'll take St. Petersburg and Sweden and
you'll take Romania and Sevastopol, as well as, of course, whatever you can get off the
Turks.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Hopefully it all actually works out that way! It’s gonna be messy over here if me
turkey and Russia all can’t trust each other

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: It's already messy all over, hopefully it ends in our favor

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Once again I feel like allying with you is the best move because you talk more
than anyone else hahaha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, literally nobody aside from you has responded for like 24 hours

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: It makes it very hard to build alliances, I realize people have jobs and stuff
but still it’s hard

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, not sure what it is.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Lmk when you have time to talk

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I've got time right now, btw, the Turks just came to me asking if I was
interested in attacking you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Okay he’s a confusing player, I think I need to trust him short term but keep an
eye on him

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well he also just said that if the two of you can get on the same page Russia's
done for, so I think he wants to give it another shot.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah he does, may have been reaching out to you because he is iffy on me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: He’s worried about you and France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I mean shit, I'm worried about me and France too. Our position as friends is
tenuous at best if you ask me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: 😂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: And they barely fuckin' talk

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I need to know if I'm moving into the North Sea or not damnit!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: What is your stance on me taking War

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Like how opposed are you, because I understand that you could risk it and try and
just take it your self

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm not terribly opposed, but me taking it would have us in better position to
take Moscow if you ask me, assuming that Ukraine isn't displaced.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That’s true, to be honest my reasoning is that Turkey is freaking out about you
and if I support you in I might lose him for good. For that reason he wants me to cut
support in Sev so that he can take Rum or attack Mos to either take that or bounce it. I
don’t wanna do either of those things so I thought if you support me in then you are happy
because russia loses a center, Turkey is happy because you don’t gain one, and I am happy
because I gain one

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: However your reason for being happy isn’t as convincing as ours

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well the real problem in any case is that if you get too buddy buddy with the
Turks, the Italians lose a lot of incentive to be your ally and gain a lot of incentive to
hit you while your back's turned.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: And the Turks honestly don't have more than a tenuous and temporary reason to be
your friend either.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Totally understand that, I don’t want to be allied with the Turks but warring
them and Russia at the same time is a pain in the ass. I’m convinced that they are against
Russia and will help me until they know russia will go down (which could very well only be
this fall or fall and spring)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, once the Russians lose Warsaw they're on the ropes and have very little
chance of stopping us, and the Balkans are pretty well tied up in any case as long as the
Italians remain dedicated.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I am still talking to Italy and would have no issues with them attacking turkey,
I just don’t want turkey attacking me. As for an Italian stab, they are now in a position
where attacking me is a multi turn process that I would see coming

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: True, unless they build in Venice.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Fair, still not that worried about Italy though. I would definitely trust them
more than turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Same, and with France breathing down their necks they're unlikely to consider
treachery.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So what are your final thoughts on my proposal

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: If you don’t like it you don’t need to lie to me but I feel like it’s a solid
compromise

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I would certainly prefer having Warsaw myself, and eventually I would prefer to
get it from you, but if you think that it'd be better for you to have it I will support
that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I am not against an eventual transfer as long as it would not result in a disband

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Of course, it would be in a season where you'd made gains.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So yes you will support?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I will.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Thank you, owe you one

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright, the Turkish/Russian Alliance is pretty thoroughly ruined at this point,
think it's safe to double down with the Italians to crush them now.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Fair, thank you for actually sending me into War. We might even be able to do a
transfer this spring

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Though if you told  the Italians that you were moving on Bulgaria they might be
understandably miffed to have missed that opportunity.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: That would be really nice, I could really use the units.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: No I didn’t tell them that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Ill be able to use my new one to push back russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well pushing back Russia isn't really the concern anymore, they're going to have
to disband, the real concern now needs to be curbing the Turks before they gain enough
momentum on you two.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The Russians are all kinds of out of position to boot.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah plus they have zero allies

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Unless you count the British, but they made no attempt to help out this time.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So France is going full split fronts, how’re you feeling about getting through
england

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: It'll be slow, but as soon as Russia's dispatched properly the British won't be
able to stop me hammering through them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’m trying to figure out if I wanna convince Italy to lay off of turkey


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright, so Warsaw can support do what it likes, but helping me into Livonia
would be pretty ideal.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I’ll do that but you need to support War holding then with Sil

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: That's the plan

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: What do you think russia will do with Gal this turn lol. Such a wild card

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I could see him moving/retreating into Boh just to make my life difficult

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: My bet's that he'll pull it back to Ukraine, try to survive rather than just
cause trouble.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Hopefully

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’m gonna reach out to england about seeing if they would take St P, even though
it would be selfish and short sighted of him it might be enticing enough for him to do it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: We could already take it away later, england is rarely able to hold Russian
territories

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: *always

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: It would be good Intel for France and I as well, to see if we can afford to get
aggressive with our fleets.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’ll let you know if he even responds

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Are you hitting BOT this turn? I think you should

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, want to force the Russians to have to retreat with the fleet so I can jump
into Sweden.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Okay cool

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Any chance you could approach turkey about attacking me once russia is done? I
don’t trust that I’m not his next expansion target.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I would do the same for you if you would like

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I already have gotten several messages from them asking if I'm interested in
attacking you, which is why I've been warning you that they could go after you at any
moment and you shouldn't trust them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: How recently

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Monday. I can check again if you'd like, but in any case siding with the Turks is
a sucker's bet for you. Once Russia's gone they have nowhere to expand and they're at your
back, and siding with them will rapidly erode Italy's willingness to side with you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Interested to see if Russia has actually quit

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Same. Turks have yet to respond to me seeing how interested they are in betraying
you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Haven’t talked to me yet either

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Do you think taking Gre was a bad move

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, you can count on Italy not being fans of the move.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Turkey's starting to respond, their biggest question so far is how we would split
you, east/west or north/south.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I personally wouldn't have done it, you need the Italians to keep the French off
your border and to help if the Turks decide to take you down, andthe Turks have no reason
not to want you dead if the opportunity arises. You don't need them for Russia anymore, so
who do you need them for? What do they need you for? Furthermore, where can they go now to
expand?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I’m just going to have to anticipate the stab. Honestly I was tired of
working with Italy. He was constantly reading the board poorly, saw France coming and
mishandled it, and other stuff.

germany: Alright, move into Moscow and I'll get into Warsaw, seems like a good time to do
the transfer.

austria: He says he’s convoying it to Apu, seems legit and if he moves it to Bul instead I
will see it coming

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I need to figure out what direction I wanna go now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Not to sound like a broken clock or anything, but Turkey's got very little option
but to fight you at this point, that's a pretty good direction to point yourself.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Neither of us are in a position for it right now though

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So what are you gonna do, you committed a lot of stuff East that isn’t very
useful anymore

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, probably going to finish off the Brits, then I'm not sure honestly.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That’s fair. Do you buy that turkey is moving Con to Apu

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Personally? Not really, but it's possible.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: My only holdup with it is that he could have just built the army in Smy then

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Exactly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Gonna see if France is willing to talk, will let you know what he says about you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: If he says anything

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: He hasn't spoken to me in a while, not sure what's up.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I’m gonna at least try and figure out some Italy stuff

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Can do. Told you the Turks were no good.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Glad that I moved against them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, things are about to get reeeeal hectic over there. Not sure how much I can
help.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Me either, I’m honestly not sure I can win

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: It might be possible if you reconcile with the Italians and help them push off
the French.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: It would at the very least become a lot more likely. Turkish naval supremacy
makes things immensely difficult for you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm all in on your side here but my navy's on the other side of the map and
armies can only touch Turkey and shore you up if I enter your personal space, so to speak.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Ya I don’t know how much you can do right now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’d be fine with you trying to get into position to be

germany: What do you need from Warsaw?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Can you support Rum to Ukr, and can you support Mos H

austria: What kind of win are you thinking? You probably won’t be able to solo unless you
take out France soon

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: No idea, probably some form of draw but it's hard to say who all would be
involved at this point.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: And yes, I can do that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Everything good?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yup yup, everything's good over here

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The heck are the Turks up to even?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Ugh, I feel like a jerk putting the knife in France's back this hard. Feels way
worse than what I did to the Turks last time.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Turkey thought we had an alliance but the last time we talked he said he was
attacking Me until we figured it out. We never talked because I was a little in active I
didn’t reach out until last night so I had to put in orders against him. He trusted me
blindly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: France is bummed, just sent us a mass message to attack you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, I hope that you won't, that would put a damper on things.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Haha yes it would

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: There is no way that I can, no way turkey doesn’t attack me for the rest of the
game now

germany: Yeah you really kinda have to get rid if them if you want to go forward with
anything else

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Good to see that Turkey is progressing well! If the French disband in Tyrolia,
would you mind if I jump in? I'd like to hasten their demise by denying them Venice,  if
possible.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Denying who Venice

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The French of course

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Gotcha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, moot anyways I suppose. They're staying put it seems. How goes Turkey?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Eh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I really haven’t enjoyed this game, austria is my least favorite country

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I like Austria honestly, generally if you lose it's very early, and it requires
good communication.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: With any luck, the game will be over soon enough anyways, the French really have
no recourse here.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Soon as you take out the Turks and the Italians we can end it, and the Turks are
definitely on the ropes.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: If you had more troops this direction I'd suggest we could work together to
displace Tyrolia with one of your armies, but you'd have to cover Trieste and Turkey could
easily take advantage of that in the current state.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Are you saying two way?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Unless you can think of anyone else who we'd include.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I thought you would go solo

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Why would I do that?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Lol because you probably can

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I mean, I probably could have last time too, if I hadn't spent half the game with
6 armies sitting around doing nothing lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Fair, well I’d be happy to be included

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Outstanding prediction on that French move, if that wasn't a coincidence.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Haha thanks, yeah it was a guess

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Now I have to guess right again

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: If the Italians were more enthusiastic revanchists this would be easier, I kinda
wish you hadn't moved into Ionian, it really spooked them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: They hate me anyways

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: No offense, but that *is* mostly on you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Oh of course

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’m terrible with Austria, I freak out and don’t trust anyone.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Everyone on the board except you hates me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Can't imagine why the French would, but apparantly they want to pick fights with
you too now.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: For me the problem country is Italy. Can never get the hang of it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Tbf I can't even really talk, the British are being extremely uncooperative
because of my previous action against them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I actually like Italy, as you know I try as hard as I can to ally with Russia. If
I can’t get that then usually Turkey will attack Austria with me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, Italy's really one where you have to go with the Russians or get REALLY
unorthodox, the generally accepted path is kinda crap.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Most Italians just start a fight with Austria without reaching out to other
people that’s the issue

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I suppose it's another one that requires really good coordination. I can never
convince the French it isn't worth it though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: As Italy?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: These games through the study are the only ones I have ever really played where
France goes for Italy. I don’t know if it’s because players are more experienced here or
just a coincidence

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Not sure, I've seen it fairly frequently.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Usually France is busy freaking out about E/G in my games

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: In games I'm in England and France are generally the ones fucking Germany over.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I always feel like that goes poorly for england

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Depends if France is the kind of fool that doesn't build fleets.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: True

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Would you like me to come down and help expel the French? I can mobilize Munich
and Warsaw to the task. It would involve moving into Bohemia and Tyrolia, but drastic
times call for drastic measures.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I’d appreciate it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Not a good turn for me I made some bad guesses

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: No worries, I'll come down to help out.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: So I just realized that my mind made a goof and Warsaw doesn't border Bohemia.
Would you mind terribly if I moved into Galicia to help ensure you can expel the French?
From there we can mutually bounce in Budapest while displacing Venice (Assuming that you
don't successfully occupy Budapest in Spring). You'll need to hold Budapest on your own
power for the first turn though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Also, if you retreat to the Adriatic you can take Venice uncontested.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Do you think it'd be a good idea for me to temporarily occupy Vienna to deprive
the French of the dot? Or would you be uncomfortable with that you think

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I mean it’s not mine right now, go for it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: If I could get in it would be a different story

attack through Armenia.

Warsaw from there.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah you have to because of that French unit, he’s annoyingly

being a thorn in our mutual side.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: He says I’m letting you win, honestly all my chips are on us doing a two way. I
can’t stop you so I might as well hope you wanna win together Lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I sure would love to, but at this point I'm not sure it's possible, these games
are limited to year 10 and that's rapidly approaching. I don't think we can make up the
lost ground for you even if they all post four no-orders turns.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: There's basically only two ways for this to finish, four way draw and German
victory. I hate to say it and I won't suggest one over the other to you, but I think it
should be clear which I'd greatly prefer.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Ya plus I just messed up

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

germany: Definitely going to stop me or definitely going to see?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Lol we’ll see. I doubt we can stop you at this point

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

either way depending on how you four move.

certain things sorted out and understood between us I'm afraid that any conflict that
might arise would surely sink us both.  First thing's first, I would greatly prefer if we
could keep  Silesia and Prussia demilitarized, as well as Bohemia should such a situation
arise.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hi hello, I agree there's no need to start a ruckus on the eastern front. Truce on
those three for now. Where are you looking to head first?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The British are an existential threat to anyone with a border on the Atlantic,
I'd prefer to dispatch them first and foremost.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Agreed - I'll be in swe, you take den for now?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: That's the plan, though in the future, after the British are gone, I'd very much
like to make Sweden and Denmark demilitarized as well.

Russians, in my experience.

day before the turn in and apparently never clicked "update" on the finalized version x.x
I'm a complete mess this game, you can just ask France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: never trust the germans, they told me!

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting

things like Belgium and perhaps other situations as you see fit, right here at the start.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: agreed.  What would you like to see happen in Belgium? What are your thoughts on
bouncing Russia?  I'm open to many possibilities.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well I personally would quite like to have Belgiun but I'm willing to listen to
reasons why I shouldn't get it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: i think that depends on the russia question

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: It certainly does! Russia hasn't communicated with me yet, I'm starting to think
that they don't even want to be my friend

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Well considering Frances opening I’d say you and I can work well against France.
I’ve already discussed with Italy putting some pressure on piedmont and the med. what do
you up say, you game for a EG sweep?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Right, that opening is particularly aggressive. I'm guessing that they're mostly
doing it to try and keep you out of Belgium, but in any case it signals that they don't
want to be your friend either. I'm guessing you'll move back to London?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: it seems i have no choice.  what has your communication with france been like?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: It's been pretty limited, made some agreements regarding Belgium but aside from
that they've been cagey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: well you you'll be getting 3 builds.  I would appreciate armys over fleets to
help go after France if possibe.  You think that's in the cards?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, be honest with you, the agreement was that *they* would have Belgium, so if
you want you can successfully bounce them there, since going from the English Channel is
the only means of doing so.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: I don't trust the French not to try to play me for a patsy and you're far more
communicative anyways, might as well tell you stuff that'll give you the upper hand.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: By the way, the Russians are doing some really sus stuff, you wouldn't happen to
be friendly with them would you?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: On second thought, the fact that the French don't feel trustworthy means that
they're probably lying when they say they'll move to Belgium. I dunno. Take it how you
will.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Russia is not very happy with my double fleet East so I haven’t gotten much from
him. I’m hearing rumors of an early jug forming.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: France stabbed me out the gate. We had a dmz in the channel. I’m wary of trusting
him. I hope you make a play at Belgium.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I can read a Juggernaut when it's happening, this is definitely one of them.
Russia wouldn't be going after the Austrians otherwise. You mind supporting me into Sweden
in the Spring? We need to head that eventuality off at the pass by all means necessary.

otherwise. Unfortunate that Russia messed up. I hope we can work together against France.
I can make a great ally.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Look man, the French have been pretty agreeable so far so I'm staying out of
their way for the most part, I'm just trying to focus on the Russians and keep enough in
the West that I can't be easily taken by surprise to be honest.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

the game.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: with you getting builds and france getting nothing, this might be as good a time
as any to stab.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: mun-bur, hol-bel, den support hel-nth

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: let's work together

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well the question is, at this point, with me having mistreated you thusfar, what
incentive do I have to trust you not to do something squirrely instead of working with me?
No offense meant or anything.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: none taken.  i'm only looking for survival.  i was double stabbed by france and
you so it's not like i'm trying to single you out.  If I have any shot of staying on the
board it's to convince you to stab france and maintain my island.  i don't think there's
anything gained other than spite by messing with you and that also means i ultimatley die
off.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I only ask because your *best* shot by far, if you asked me, is if you get me to
betray France, but at the same time you take a supply center from me so that you keep all
your pieces, and at the same time throw a wrench in my betrayal so that France and I will
be on roughly equal footing while at each other's throats; Bonus points if you're also
relaying the plans of betrayal to the French so that they can be countered.  After all, if
I win outright you've only delayed the inevitable haven't you? Better to make it messy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: But I'm willing to throw you a bone: I won't tell you what I'm going to do with
my units in detail, but I will support you into the North Sea.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I have no way of taking you down a SC.  my fleet in HEL could take kiel but you
can cover with BER and either you get BEL or I bounce HOL.  Either way you're still up
because of Norway.  Either way, I hope we get to work together.

intensely strange.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: how so?  you've got a dmz with France, two on Warsaw, and no bad options in the
north.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Brits and Russians start working together they can pry through my weak spot in
the north. Wouldn't be good.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

response to an  aggressive FG."

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: Still leaves a lot of unanswered questions on what happens next.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: you're probably going to self bounce in Denmark.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So, now Russia gains Sweden, is way out of position, and probably has to pull one
as long if Austria and I can get on the same page.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, still thinking if anything could be better than that though. The fact that
they didn't bounce me in Sweden in the first place this last turn is a pain.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: well, there's worse things than getting into a supply center.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

out of position in having done so.

on their part considering they'll be your next best target and you're gaining more than
them out of this deal. Besides which, with Italy's help they could easily have taken both
you and Russia. Want to split them down the middle with me?

turkey: And what does "down the middle" mean?  Are we talking East West or North South?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: North South, probably.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm fine with that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Do you have anything you’d like to coordinate?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’m a little hesitant to go after Austria right now, but I could be swayed by your
actions.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I mean to take St. Petersburg this season without antagonizing the Austrians, but
after that it's pretty free game. They're concerned about your army build.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Some people see threats everywhere.


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: What are your thoughts about Moscow? I’d like to take a unit off of Austria.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: Was going to take St. Petersburg first, but if you support Warsaw into Moscow I
wouldn't say no.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well, he’d just retreat to STP.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Mind supporting me in?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: You went after Ukraine?


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: You didn't respond, I didn't change my orders accordingly. In any case it did no
damage.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Fair enough

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Big plans for this year?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Anything we can do together?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: If you’re n attacking Moscow or anything, I’d appreciate you to support me to hold
in Ukraine.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I've got no big plans, but I could certainly help you hold. Couldn't you use
Sevastopol though?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sev is supporting something else. I got to get some dots!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: Fair enough, gotta get those dots.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: Odd moves

Between germany, france:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Good afternoon, I think it's important that you and I come to terms over a few
things right here at the start, including the fate of Belgium and how despite our
situation as naturally suited antagonists, Britain is the larger threat to both of us.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hey Germany. "Natural suited antagonists"? I beg to differ. I personally think
that over here in the west, a France/Germany alliance is the strongest, preferably taking
out England ASAP. What do you think?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I spoke to England and they don't seem like a particularly diplomatic player, but
I'm pretty sure I can get into the English channel. From there I would like to move to
Belgium, since they will most likely be moving back to London. In return for Belgium I
would be willing to support or convoy you into English territory.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, England hasn't spoken to me just yet, so it sounds like perhaps they won't
intend to be friendly with me whatsoever. I think that your plan sounds pretty solid, I'll
support you into Belgium if need be.   I only say Natural Antagonists because that's how
it frequently goes, notwithstanding the strength of the alliance. I personally find it
quite strong, and not nearly as asymmetrical as alliances between either of us and the
Brits.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Taking the English down ASAP is definitely something on my agenda though, one
less front line to worry about.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Great. I'll move the the English channel. What are you thinking for moves?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Mostly just pivoting toward the low countries, Kiel to Denmark and probably to
the North Sea from there.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good.


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: So you're headed to Belgium now from the Channel, yes?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That would be ideal. It's a bit of a gamble, but England will probably will think
I'm going to Lon. It would be greatly appreciated if you supported me in but you don't
have to. I don't know what else Ruh would do though...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Eh, the English say they're moving to London, no need for the support; I need to
send some troops over East, don't trust the Russians.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: I don't trust the French not to try to play me for a patsy and you're far more
communicative anyways, might as well tell you stuff that'll give you the upper hand.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: *English

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Fuckin' brain getting words mixed up and making me look sus. >.>

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Ruhr is moving back to Munich to deploy east, regardless. The Russians bouncing
the Austrians in Galicia indicates that they're going to do a Juggernaut and I have to do
everything I can to stymie that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: and... you really trust england?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: They are most likely not telling the truth

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: But ok sounds good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: No, I don't, but I think they'd be idiots to do anything else. But if you're
really worried, I can support you in and keep the pivot to the East for next year.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I would try to get into Englands territory with your fleet

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: No, it's fine, don't support

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: I intend to, but I can't leave Denmark till it's secured without putting myself
way out of position for anything in the east if the Russians get aggressive. You sure you
don't want the support?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: No, of course I want the support, as it can't possibly help me and adds an extra
layer of protection. I just thought you brought up a fair point about russia, and it's
your choice, so I'm not going to argue with you a ton about what you should do.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: To be honest I wouldn't be to worried about Russia. They didn't even move towards
you, and after hearing what you said I talked with Austria, and they said they were going
to attack Russia, so I don't think there is an alliance there. I would instead invest in
capturing english territory, which would give you troops to build in your homeland and
defend against Russia if they choose to attack you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Fair enough, I'll focus on the English first then.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Ok, and will you be supporting me into Burgundy? Up to you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: You mean Belgium? Sure, nothing better to do for the time being.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yes, belgium. Oops


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, I didn't hit the button to update the orders, but it worked out just fine
anyways I suppose.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: My bad.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yes, it's fine. Sooo, ig the game is in grace period, so I was wondering what you
builds were looking like. I will build a fleet in Bre and if you build a fleet in Kiel,
the 4 combined fleets should be more than enough to take out britain, and we shouldn't
have to build anything else in that regard.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm building a fleet in Kiel. Most of my armies are going to move East to counter
the Juggernaut that's actively happening over there, but I'll dedicate one army and both
fleets to dropping the English.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: great


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What are you thinking about moves? We should coordinate

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Moving into Helgoland Bight, probably moving into Sweden with Britain's help
while I can still manipulate them into thinking I'm their friend rather than their foe
(Kill two birds with one stone, you know), two armies move East.


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright, we have a good chance of making it into the North Sea if you support
Helgoland Bight into it with both fleets. Unfortunately it seems the British called my
bluff early and the Russians have committed to taking Sweden, so things aren't exactly
ideal, but we're still in a pretty definitively winning position.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Russians really fucked me up by not bouncing me in Sweden. Good move on their
part.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hey Germany. It's a shame Russia called your bluff. I will support helgoland into
nth with both of my fleets. We should have a 100% chance of getting in if you attack Nwy
with sweden and cut support. This is the best move for sweden in any scenario, as that
territory is basically lost, and who knows, maybe england will move Nwy to Stp and you
will end up getting Nwy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, the only worry is that England will move North Sea to Denmark, which would
be a damn shame and a pain in my ass.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: And if they're displaced they could *retreat* there, which would just add insult
to injury.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Ah, good point. I don't have anything for Pic to do, do you think I should have
Eng convoy it over to whales? Or do you think it would be more useful to support you in

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Also, would you mind telling italy the following: "Hey Italy. You probably know I
have an alliance with france, and they have troops right next to you. They told me that
they were going to support themselves into Piedmont. I'm letting you know because I'm
worried about them getting too strong and stabbing me, as they already have 6 centers." Or
something like that, just in your own words. I want them to think I'm supporting myself
into Piedmont.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Picardy can stay put for now, I think that the English will anticipate us doing
something other than trying to take the North Sea and will move to prevent it, if they
think we're thinking far enough ahead. It's worth the gamble that they'll only throw one
support at it. Besides, in all likelihood even if you tried to move to Wales, Yorkshire
would block it, since Yorkshire isn't doing anything useful where it is now.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Will do, can't guarantee they'll believe me though.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Sent it along, in my own words.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: thx mate

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What do you think I should do in the med with italy? I could either move LYO to
WES, hoping to bounce them there(why I had you send that message), and have Mar attack
Pie, or I could just support myself in and if they do go to WES i'll move my fleet in the
English channel down to cover spain/portugul

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: If you convoyed from Spain to Tuscany it'd be all over for them, effectively.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Everything worked exactly as planned it seems!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: yep.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: Only worry now is where the Brits will retreat to.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Im pretty confident they can't retreat to denmark, because it was contested this
turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: They can't, but they can retreat to SKA


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: So what do you think would be the best move? You think England's going to try to
dislodge North Sea with all their navies or do you think they'll want to cover Edinburgh
more?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: i really don't know.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think I will support Nth with belgium, but convoy Pic to whales

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Good idea, even if we lose North Sea that'll get us into the isles, then it's
game over for them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: that's the idea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Ok, it's a shame we lost the north sea but it was inevitable, at least we got
whales. England should be gone in a few turns and then I can focus all my energy on Italy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If we continue to trust each other, communicate, and play well I think we have a
two-way victory in the bag

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Next turn I can support you into Nth again, and you will definitely get it, since
I have the army in whales to cut support

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Try to suck up as many of russias supply centers as you can, they are very weak
and seem to be afk

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, hopefully, if all goes well, I'll be building quite a lot. Austria's
betrayal of Italy in favor of Turkey is really telling so I think I'll have my hands full
on that front soon enough. A two way victory sounds splendid to me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: How will we split Britain?


1903, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Um, so this turn I think I'm going to support myself into london, but also support
you into the Nth sea. From there you can take Edi, and I can support you into that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Nah, focus on succeeding in London, poke North Sea with Belgium so that it can't
support. I'm supporting myself into Sweden and moving on Norway from there; if you want to
simplify things we could have you take all of Britain and just transfer Belgium to me (So
that we both net 2 from the British, since I'll have Norway), though I would understand
why you might be uncomfortable with that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm really torn over what to do in Italy. I spoke to Austria about going after
them together, and they are thinking about it. I could try convoying Mar into Tuscany,
with Pie supporting. This is basically the same as just moving Pie into Tuscany, with
support from my fleet, except for that if I convoy Mar the support is less likely to be
cut(I think there is a higher chance they will cut support to my fleet than cut
support/move to Piedmont)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The Austrians are currently making a whole slew of bad decisions, allying with
the Turks is a sucker's bet. I'm not sure what you should do tbh, the Italians aren't
talking to me much anymore.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I suppose we could have me take all of Britain, and have me give you Belgium, but
I would ask that as soon as you take Belgium, you move back out. It's definitely an
option, but I will have to think about it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Oh of course, once I had it I'd get out of there immediately. Trust is the key in
transfers like this.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Take your time, we've got several turns until it needs settling, and several days
till the next turn.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I could move Piedmont to Tyr, it's a great place to be. Not sure if I would get in
though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Tyr is one of those spots where everyone around gets nervous when you're there.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yep, Austria wouldn't like that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Good tactical utility though, if you want to strongarm into Venice.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I feel like we could very well end up with a standoff between me and you, and
turkey and austria. I'm kinda trying to brew unrest over there, spreading rumours and
such.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I have been desperately attempting to convince the Austrians that they're better
off with me but it hasn't  been working.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Why didn't you want me supporting you? My move into Lon was already garunteed.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Whatever

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I was thinking either the British or Russians would make a play for Sweden,
wanted the support to ensure the move. In any case we should have an easy time moving
forward.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: In any case we're both making pretty good gains.


1903, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'll be building in Munich, just so I don't catch you by surprise with that. Want
to be able to move in as fast as possible on the Austrians when we go for it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: What do you think the next move should be?


1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Could you support Bel to Nth?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Absolutely. My fleet in Denmark wouldn't be doing anything otherwise. Are you
moving in with Piedmont or Tyrolia? Because if it's not Tyrolia I can support that to stay
put, just in case the Austrians get antsy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm having Tyrolia support piedmont in. I will definitly get it unless for some
reason the austrians support italy, which would be wierd.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thanks for supporting Bel

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Feel free to support Tyr, but don't feel pressure to do so if you have a better
move in mind

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm waiting to have St. Petersburg to make a move on the Austrians, Munich has
nothing to do for the moment except to support Tyrolia.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Everything worked out great.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: And it looks like the Turks and Austrians are at each others throats now.


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: The Brits are trying really hard to get me to throw myself against you. I mean
reeeeeally hard.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: lol. All I can say is that I hope you don't, since we have this game in the bag

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You could use that. Tell them you will stab me, and tell them my moves(but false)
so that I can get in more easily

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I can probably jump into Edinburgh via the Norwegian sea this next year, no need
for the Belgium transfer.


1904, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: LOL italy just messaged me and said that "Austria's build in Trieste cannot be
anything but a play for Venice" and then "I am willing to concede it to you if you
cooperate elsewhere", so I guess they don't understand I already have it. They sure are
getting desperate.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Think I should play along, or just tell them about what "concede" really means,
and that you can't concede something if your opponent controls it and you have no chance
of getting it back.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Also, what do you think I should do for builds? A fleet in Brest or an army in
Paris?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Go ahead, play along lol, should be interesting. If I were you I'd build fleets,
the enemy from here on out is one on the seas almost exclusively.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: k, what do you think about builds?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Would you be ok with me building army in paris? I would send it over to the south
east prob

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Not sure, at least one army, might build a navy even though I won't have much use
for it anymore.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: You can if you want, but I think a Navy would do a lot to forcing the
Mediterranean open faster. Italy's a huge traffic jam for armies.


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Do you still want belgium? At this point our borders are like, super
demiliterized, which is pretty nice, but at this point I do trust you, if you want to have
it. If you want an center it would prob be better for you to have belgium than enland. Or
do you even want a center, since you already have 1 more than me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Well, I certainly wouldn't say no, you'll definitely have an easier time taking
the Italians than I will bleeding anything from the Austrians.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Whoa, didn't realize we were so close to adjudication. What are you thinking for
moves?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I don't need support from you anywhere this turn. All my units will be making
moves at englands centers/taking the med/taking italy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: All I can say is that I REALLY hope you don't betray me, since you have some units
looking like they could just walk into my supply centers. We have such a good run going
right now, as long as you don't betray me we can definitly get a two-way draw

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: I think I'm gonna move on the Austrians, take them out while they're distracted
with the Turks.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: England and Italy both are truly desperate to get me to turn on you, and even the
Austrians have thrown some urgings in lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: lol yes, the Austrians hate me for staying in Triest when I told them I would
move, Italy has been desperatly begging for DMZ, and England is obviously done.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Right, and Austria can't possibly take me and Turkey at the same time

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: As long as we keep austria and turkey fighting, you can run them down by land and
I can apply presure with fleets

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah, I'm playing both sides to keep them at each other's throats.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: great

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: For the record I really hate doing crap like this but I told myself right at the
start that I needed to gussy up and go for a solo for once in my life. I love this game
but ironically hate the deception aspect >.>  In any case it's nothing personal and you
were super cool to work with

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Tbh I was pretty sure you would do that, but (for once) I wanted to trust somebody
in this game bc I've been known to backstab people like crazy. Your all good, Imma put up
a fight though and try to stop you 😉

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You were cool to work with to

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Good luck. We did have the two way draw in the bag though

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Wow, you really are pouring units into my hometown. Basically leaving Austria and
turkey alone, huh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I know we did, and to be honest I've been super wishy washy about actually going
through with this because of that. I almost did it last turn. I still feel like a jerk
doing it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: And yeah, as long as they're at each other's throats they aren't too much threat,
unless you pull some silver tongue on them to get a real coalition of the willing going

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Silver toung it is. It's going to be pretty great if I can get them to organize
then we can actually win against you and that would be cool. Well see

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: That would be exceptionally interesting! I wouldn't have a lot of chance to shore
up that flank, it'dbe a fair and square win. In any case, good luck, and sorry about this,
again.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Your good, I (almost definitly) would have done the same.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I normally don't, just because I feel like actually being trustworthy most of the
time generally improves the game culture. Or maybe I'm just soft and making excuses, hard
to say lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: 🤷‍♂️

turkey: Let's talk '02.  Let's say you take Rumania.  That will leave Serbia and Greece
open.  Who gets what?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I get Serbia you get Gre? That would leave us at 2 and 2

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: that is a fair swap.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: Okay great, I’ll head into Rum then


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Well we don’t trust each other

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: well, Russia told me that he was going to bounce me in the black sea.  I figured,
what's the worst that could happen?  you bounce him in Rumania?  If i support you in, you
only get one build.  So, since you said you were cool with me having greece in the long
term, why not go for it in the short term?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: yeah, I didn't talk to you about going to greece, but ... this isn't chutes and
ladders.    However, we're now in really good position to make short work of Russia if we
work together.  Thoughts?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I would love support into Rum, how would you eventually wanna divide things?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: I get Greece.  And then we split Italy.  Also, I'd appreciate a boost into
Sevastapol, but the rest of Russia would be yours.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: The trick will be getting to Italy before France does.  What would help is if
Italy would head West towards France.  That'll leave his back door open for us.  Maybe if
you told him that you didn't have any interest in helping against Turkey and that he
should make a go another direction, but ... then again ... after bouncing in Trieste twice
in a row, he might not be super interested in working with you.


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: We arranged bouncing in Tri, I might be able to convince him since France build
that fleet in Mar

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Which unit do you want supported into Rumania?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
austria: I’ll move Ser in

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Are we still good?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Yes.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: I’m cutting Sev and supporting ser-rum. I assume since I haven’t heard anything
from Russia he thinks he’s working with you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: I’d support yourself to hold in Galicia, but you might have other designs for your
units.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: If you think I should then I will

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Either that or keep being aggressive.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: It’d be nice to bounce him in Ukraine and force a retreat off the board.


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’m sorry I didn’t trust you, everything I was seeing made me feel like you were
allied with Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hmmm. Where do we go next?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Well I guess my first question is whether or not you still trust me. You can ask
Italy or Germany, I thought I saw a juggernaut forming and that would have been the end of
my game. I had to play it safe especially since you switched moves on me last fall.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I understand how you could say the same about me but I’m in the more vulnerable
position.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: It’s possible that you could take Rum this turn if Russia doesn’t defend it. They
seem like a bit of a wild card so who knows what they will decide to do. You could go for
that on your own and when you see that I don’t attack you this season you might be able to
trust me enough to move this forward.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think ... I think you have Budapest vulnerable. I’d appreciate it if UKR either
went for Moscow or Sevastopol.   We have to worry about the Western Triple.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So, let’s get our armies into Russia and counter Germany there.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Do you think you can get me into Sev?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Like can you commit BLA to supporting me in

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well, that fleet is busy attacking Rumania.  I would like a build, which I think
is fair.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: What is Serbia doing?  Maybe Serbia can support me into Rumania?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: I think I need to protect my homeland with Ser

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But ... me trusting you, after you lied to me ... that's a tall order.  I'm not
closed off to it, but I'd like to know if you know what the Italian is planning on doing.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I understand that you would want a build, but then there is no reason for me to
attack Sev

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well, SEV could be supporting GAL back to Rumania.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Well to be completely honest we were gonna attack you because I was convinced
that you were allied with Russia so I have some stuff to figure out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: I think our first order is deciding what we think russia is gonna do

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I know that it doesn't benefit you any, and I think your better move it to go for
Moscow.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I might be able to convince Italy to back up since they have the French to deal
with

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I would appreciate that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Game moves tonight at midnight right

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think that Russia is probably on the weaker end of the spectrum.  I think that
he goes defensive.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: He might lash out at Vienna, but it is extremely unlikely that he goes for
Budapest while you move to Vienna.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think, honestly, that he supports himself back into Rumania and covers Moscow.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Which is why I was requesting that you go for Sevastopol, cutting it's support.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That would be the smart move, he seems irrational though. He doesn’t really
negotiate and is very aggressive

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: yes, I don't disagree.  I'm a little disappointed that you thought I was going to
blindly ally with him!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: What do you think Italy is going to do with A Greece?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: was he supposed to support you into Bulgaria?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: He just offered but I’m explaining to him that you attacked Russia last turn, he
didn’t realize

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I've asked him to allow us to go after Russia while he gets into a better position
against France.  We need to drive a wedge into this Western Triple.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok, I now realize that there's no Western Triple.  Instead, it's an FG - which is
just as bad for you guys, since Germany is already into Russia.  Here's my idea, and take
it or leave it ... but I suggest that he keep rotating his fleets out (maybe move towards
WES and TUN) while you backfill ION.  He builds a fleet in ROM and you convoy him into NAP
in the Spring.  Now he's got three fleets in play while France is trying to land a unit on
England.  Meanwhile, you move your army out of SER and towards Munich and I move BUL/RUM
north into SEV, MOS, and WAR.  It's a logical expansion for all of us and presents each of
us with room to grow and peace in the Balkans.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’m gonna have to think about it because so far germany has been a good friend
for me this game

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Right.  And where is he going to go next?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And when you say good friend ... what supply centers did he help you into?  🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Totally understandable, just has been giving good information and stuff. Right
now his plan is to eat France after england (could be a lie but I would believe it)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Right ... with what units?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: France has three armies.  If he gets into England, he'll get more builds.  Unless
you're going to help him get past FRance in the south, he'll have armies in France for
defense.  And if you're anti-Italy ... then we should be having a totally different
conversation!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm not saying that you should sign up 100% for the "go after Germany" party.
But, I've presented you with a fair proposal and it doesn't require you to do anything
that's against your interests.  And if it can clear up your border in the south, it can
let you access "where the dots are," which for you - is Germany.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I gotcha, I’ve gotta eat dinner right now but how late tonight will you be able
to chat

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'll be around.  Either on the computer or on my phone.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Okay I’m reading your proposal again and are you saying you would get all of
russia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I now realize what I wrote, but I do need an outlet.  If you want to see me
nothing but bottled up, and without an outlet for expansion ... we need to have another
kind of conversation.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Not without exchanging some of those centers for Rumania and/or Bulgaria.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm also totally down with attacking through Italy and pouring fleets into the
Med.  But, I am under the impression that you want to ally with him and want to find some
way to work together with you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I do not want you bottled up, bottled up turkey usually attacks Austria.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I agree with that sentiment.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: What would your thoughts be if I could get Germany to support Ukr into War

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think that would be awesome

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: it would be difficult to defend, but is the right move for you.  worry about
holding it later, get the bulwark against his growth now.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Okay we’ll go ahead with that then

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: What will happen with Serbia and Greece?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Not sure, what would you vote for

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well, I'd prefer it if you didn't cut Bulgaria's support of an attack on Rumania.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Of course not, I was probably just gonna support gre holding

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: If you trust italy not to go after Serbia, then you could rotate your armies out
(and probably bounce in one/both of them).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah still figuring that it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Is he sending his fleet to EMS or towards France?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well, you know which direction I'd prefer.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’m hoping toward France, I told him he should

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I've enjoyed speaking with you, by the way.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I hope that we can continue to have these kinds of dialogues.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah you as well, it’s good to find people that are actually able to negotiate
and stuff. I hope we can get past our early struggles

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: do you play any face-to-face?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Not much, hard to get 7 people together

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Where abouts do you live (general area, I'm not trying to cyberstalk you)?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I go to Michigan state

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: there's a sizeable hobby in Chicago

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But I don't think East Lansing is THAT close.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Haha no it is not

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I went to college in Cleveland and could never get a game together.  I did travel
to tournaments, though.  They're a lot of fun as long as you can get over yourself and
realize that every game is an opportunity to improve.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: How do tournaments work?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Three to four, more or less random, board draws.  Usually you score your best
three results.  There are a few different scoring systems, but generally speaking - if you
get good results, you'll do well.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Seems fun, how do the negotiations go? Like do you pull people aside

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: yes, usually it's in a big room - like a hotel ballroom or dormitory basement

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: and there's 3-5 boards going on simultaneously

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: so, there's about 10-30 conversations going simultaneously.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Okay so people know who you’re talking to, that is one thing I like about this is
like I could be talking to russia and you wouldn’t know it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Obviously I’m not in this case

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Or maybe you are ....

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Hahahaha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: By the way, if Serbia isn't moving, can it support CON-RUM?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: It’s moving

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: May I ask where?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Bud

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'll trust you on this one.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Italy has gotten himself way out of position. I know you like him, but ... he’s
not taking advantage of his opportunity against France and is wide open to attack by us.
You could go to Greece and I could go to Rumania and we’d have peace. (I’d have to hold
for a turn, so that he doesn’t retreat to Bulgaria).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah let’s look at the builds first


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’m also a little frustrated with him because he hasn’t replied to a single one of
my messages in days (not that I’m overloading him, but this needs to be a two way
conversation - I mean, that’s what we’re being compensated for!).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah he hasn’t chatted a ton with me either

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: 🤷‍♂️

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: you around?  I'm weighing my build options.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: any thoughts?  Fleet versus Army?


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Alright. We doing this?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: My bad, didn’t see the notifications

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So obviously you’re gonna kick Italy out of your area, are you gonna take Sev
this turn?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well, I’d like to coordinate my move with you. Are you taking Greece? He’d be down
to one Army and since he doesn’t seem interested in defending his dots from France, you
and I might as well go after them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Honestly I have to decide how much I trust you vs how much faith I have in him.
Because at this point in the game I still need an ally.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’d like for you to take Sev, it we need russia to lose more units so that we can
finish him before germany is too strong.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I feel like despite our rocky start you and I have communicated enough that we
can declare a full alliance though

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Regarding Sev, I’d like to take it this year. Maybe in the Fall?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think we can definitely partner up and work together to both our benefit. I also
don’t think it will be particularly difficult to separate our forces. I only have two
armies, so I’m not much of a threat to you and you only have one fleet - so I’m not
worried about you coming after me by yourself. The wild card in all of this is Italy, and
he’s only got one fleet over by me and a French unit in Piedmont.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Right now I have Bulgaria supporting Serbia into Greece. I’ll rotate up the coast
towards Sevastopol in the Fall and we’ll convoy you onto the boot as soon as possible. I
mean ... that’s a strong position for you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: If we were to follow this sort of path where do you see your expansion going? You
can get Sev, Tun, and Nap, then what

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Also I don’t need your support into Gre, I would rather you took Sev this turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Expansion: maybe mos and STP? I’m assuming you’re going to head west towards
Germany in this scenario. Otherwise, this is only a 10 year game, I don’t have grand
designs on a solo victory or anything.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok. I will hold in Bulgaria so that Italy can’t retreat there. And I’ll take out
Sev. You’re not dislodging Galicia, are you? I’m worried about him retreating to Rumania.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Sounds good, I am not dislodging

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: OK.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I know you're choosing between working with Italy and working with me.  The path
I'm offering to you allows you to control your own growth and depend on yourself for gains
- and making it so that our border is unit-less.  The path of working with Italy also
allows you to grow, but you'll be depending on someone else for help after the initial
gain and you'll have to dedicate units to the balkans until I'm fully eliminated from the
game.   Both are legitimate choices, but I think my offer is superior based on merit.
I've demonstrated that I'm a reliable partner, that I make solid moves and do what I say.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I gotcha, I just hate playing as austria and don’t have a lot of successful
experience. Often due to Turkey. That and the beginning of this game has made me cautious.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: But Italy’s attack on you is uncoordinated with me and not really going anywhere
and it’s hard to work with that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’m curious what your plan is. You have a lot of armies on my border.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I gotta move those, I’m sorry I was just playing cautious. Hopefully Russia
has actually quit that would make things much easier. I will definitely have to go cover
Tri because Italy is in Ven and pissed at me


1903, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’m moving EMS-ION. Can you support it in with Greece?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: (EAS)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yes

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Will you support me into años

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Mos

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I was gonna self bounce in Rumania

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Is Germany kicking you out of Warsaw?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: No but we’re trying to transfer it, it was a condition of me getting it first

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I can’t this year. He’s got that pesky A Galicia

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: Okay it’s all good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hey, I wanted to say - is it something you need to prevent the loss of a center?
Because if Germany is going to start trying to take dots off of you, you need help into
Moscow more than I need to guarantee I don’t lose Rumania. In fact, I can just cover Rum
with Bulgaria. You’re not going to stab me for one dot, I certainly hope.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I am not, yeah I was gonna make that argument but wait until we got closer to
when moves were due

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: And yes that would help guarantee that I don’t lose one

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: So how’s that sounding

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok.  I'm down for working together for mutual benefit.  I'd appreciate it if you
began moving your units away from my dots.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Was planning on it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Glad I trusted you. I think we’re past the awkward phase of our relationship.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I hope so, now I need to make sure france is just doing what they did to get into
Ven


1903, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Or end around on Germany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That would be a premature stab

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: might be his last real chance.


1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: how do you want to proceed?  Can you support ION to hold?  I'd like to convoy my
army into Apulia.  We can gut Italy like a trout, if that's what you'd like to do.
Otherwise, we could look at getting you back into Warsaw.  Is Germany where you want to
head next?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I kinda have to take care of Italy first so that front is secured

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok. Are you ok with the convoy to Apulia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Yeah of course

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Or do you want Italy all for yourself! 😊

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: No we could use the help!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Are you cool with me displacing the last Russian troop so that we don’t have to
deal with it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Also have you reached out to France about your move?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Let me look at the map.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And I’m not sure it’s a good idea to tell France what my plans are regarding
Italy. I don’t think he’s interested in sharing the prize.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: I mean, sure. Which unit is going in? I can support it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And you can focus on grabbing STP or getting position on Warsaw or Munich.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: Gal is going in

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: And France asked me to coordinate so it’s possible that he would want to with you

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Are you coordinating with him? I’d just dislodge Tyrolia - if he retreats into
Munich, that’s a win for you. If he takes Venice, we’ll get you in there in the Fall.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Not really coordinating no

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok, cool.  I don't really need to know, and I'll find out in two hours, but I'm
wondering if you'll have two units on Venice in the fall - giving us three.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
austria: I’m still not sure

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ughhh. This is going to be a slog. I guess we’ll be trading centers while Germany
and France get bigger. 🤷‍♂️


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
austria: Well this will be fun

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Unnecessary, though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Your call.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Because it’s highly unlikely France will get to me before Germany comes for you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: When you wish washed on Venice and suggested collaboration with France, I changed
all my orders.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I only did it because I didn’t trust you, I would have trusted you if you had
built that army in Smy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok. You never once said anything to me bout it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Didn’t want you to be on to me knowing


1904, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm sad, because it feels like I lost a friend.  I really enjoyed talking and
strategizing with you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: We really couldn’t trust each other, we both stabbed on the same turn twice


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: what other stab?  Are you referring to Fall '01?  Because I think it's impossible
to stab someone in '01.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Probably what I’m talking about it. How is it impossible? We both went back on an
agreement

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: 1901 is the feeling out year.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’d have to look back and see what year I’m thinking of but does it really matter

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok, so here's the thing.  One of two things is going to happen. Germany is going
to come after you (unlikely) or Germany is going to pour into France (much more likely).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But, with either scenario, I'm not sure how productive a land war with me is going
to be for your long term survival.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Agreed, I honestly don’t think I can win this game

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: well, neither of us is going to solo in 6 years.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Germany ... could.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: All he needs is Moscow and one of your centers/Marseilles.  Because he has fleet
superiority in the north and Italy just took a unit off the board.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Not probable, but possible.  but it makes sense, he's giving me the hard sell to
attack you and offering all sorts of long term assistance.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah I think he’s gonna solo unless France attacks him

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: France can't attack him.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: what is FRance going to attack him with?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I’m not saying like this season

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I mean, literally, what is he going to attack him with.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: his fleets?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Wow yeah he does have way too many fleets

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Look, we're not so stuck fighting each other.  I think we both can admit that
neither of us is going to "win" this game.  But, I'd really prefer not to "lose" the game
to  a solo.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: So what do you propose

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: That we get you into Warsaw.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm being 100% serious.  My orders right now are for a full scale attack on you.
But I'm willing to change them to be cooperative if I feel like you're being honest with
me and are actually open to working together.  I also don't "need" to get a dot right now
and am willing for you to gain - if it's off of Germany.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I will change SEV to supporting MOS to hold.  UKR will support RUM-GAL, and I
suggest you try to get into BOH so that you can cut SIL's support of WAR to hold.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I could be wrong, and Germany could not go after FRance and instead go after you
full bore.  If he does, these are EXACTLY the orders you need to use anyway.  But this
prevents the solo by Germany.  Which he could get if you and I fight.  It would be close,
but France is totally incompetent and does not have the units to mount an actual defense.
If France had build an Army in Paris, this would be a totally different conversation.  But
he built a fleet in Brest.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: You could also take advantage of the situation to re-position your fleet to
threaten Venice and take advantage of the French-German situation, but that's your call.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't try to take advantage of this situation and come at me
full bore, but - even if you did come at me strong, I'm not sure you gain much.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And you would risk A LOT by exposing your back to Germany.  Because if you do come
after me, you can be damn sure I'm helping him into Moscow and anywhere else I can.

throw the solo.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: The key to not losing to the solo is - assuming the loss of Portugal (which is two
coin flips) - not losing 2 of the 3 Russian centers.  You're going to lose STP.  The
question then becomes, how to we preserve Warsaw?  My recommendation is:  A: VIE S TYR -
BOH A: WAR - UKR A: STP - MOS A: BUD - GAL I: TYR - BOH I: TRI - TYR I: VEN - PIE I: TUS S
VEN - PIE T: SEV - UKR T: RUM S WAR - UKR T: ANK - SEV (Convoy)  This plan destroys UKR or
ensures that we control it.  It places units in places that they can cut supports on
Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or
maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat
to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself
into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow
or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either
keep munich or go after Warsaw.  The other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and
Ukraine.  I'm willing to do as you suggest.
