Game number 12
----------

Between italy, germany:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hi Italy! Just opening up communication, and I want to know what some of your
initial thoughts on the game are and if/how we can work together

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Well....that's a great question, and a lot of it comes down to how free I'll be
left to play in the West, no?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: Well, if you want to attack France in the Mediterranean while I attack through
Burgundy you can have Marseille and Iberia while I take Brest and Paris, then with France
out of the way you could focus on Turkey or Austria. Sound fair?


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hello, I'm just asking about your move to Tyrolia. It's making me more than a
little concerned

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: Totally understandable - but did you notice the attempt at Trieste?  Tyrolia is the
natural support position for that attempt 🙂


Between italy, austria:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Hey Italy! What's your plan for the game?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Bongiorno!  To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the
lamentations of their women!  I mean, umm, not really sure yet.  Pondering whether or not
to make an early play around Munich

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
austria: I'd personally rather you didn't, because a play around Munich is also a play
around Trieste and Vienna. I've heard that there's some rancor over in the West and you
might be able to profit from a mobbed France if you went that way.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Good to know, thanks!


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Well, that went well! Shall we push on with the ways we started?


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: Well, the West and East are both an unholy mess now.  Second fleet incoming, I
assume you agree we need to nip that Turkish issue in the bud before it becomes
unmanageable?


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So...was that a no?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Indeed.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Peccato.  I was really hoping we could bring order (or at least mutual profit) out
of the chaos.


1903, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Sorry we couldn't patch things up.


Between italy, russia:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hey Italy! How’s it going?!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: Hey hey, what can I say?


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hahha what’s good?


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of
their women


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hahahah that’s the spirit sir!


1903, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hey Italy - what’s good?


Between italy, england:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello Italy, just wanted to thank you for your gift to the culinary world and
wish you a good game!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Just to be clear, that was all in a pasta life.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: From this one interaction alone I trust you. Please dont betray me and make me
eat dish of regretti and meatballs.


Between italy, turkey:
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: We both hate how I vs T just slows us both down, right?  Why do we have to be the
slow powers in this game?  I say: we don't!  Let's be unconventional.  I have done fun I/T
alliances before, but it all depends on making it work.  Let me know if you have any
thoughts, or want to just see how the first few seasons roll out, or if there are things
you'd like to see from me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I mean, if I'm free to go another direction, I'll take it in a heartbeat - and I
doubt you'll be very upset at my opening moves 🙂


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: His dots are closer to you. 😃

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: hahahahaha really?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: If Austria retreats to one of your centers, I guess it means they don't care about
trying to repair anything with you, and Just Loves Them Dots, yeah?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I may be able to hit Tri in the fall, which would cut it's ability to support Ven,
by the way.  If Ion retreats to Adr, that may not help you, but if it retreats to Tun or
Nap it would, I guess?  Let's see how the retreats go.


1903, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: So, now his dots are a LOT closer to you than mine are. 😃  I'm guessing you're
ordering into Trieste anyway to protect Serbia while you take Greece with Bulgaria and
Aegean. So the question is what is ion doing?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It's at your disposal if you want support into Tunis, if that's what you're
getting at.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Oh, come now. It's much more amusing to support you into Tunis. That advances the
positions rather than retards them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Bwa! are you serious?  I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I feel
like I'm greedy enough stabbing Austria for 3!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Any other arrangement opens me for a stab and sets us up for conflict. Tunis is
better for you than Naples, and it's a lot better for me to have you there with a path
forward than tied up with me. If you feel bad about it, support me to Trieste

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok, that's totally sensible logic.  I may end up having to pass up on Greece and
catch it next year.  I can support you into Trieste, if you'd rather have that than
retaking Venice, sure.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Oh nevermind, you can get both, nice!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: unless Gre taps Ser, in which case you still recapture Ven, and Austria is
stranded in Tri.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Correct. Which is what I'm expecting, but I can hope for Trieste. 😀

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: You heartless bastard - I can't believe you took him from 5 to 0.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It was kinder this way. Put ‘em out of their misery, y’know?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Lol. Probably. That is the great thing about Austria -you either do well or you get
to go play another game.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yep. I’m finishing up game 10 of this series now as Austria. Currently on 14
centers, but England has Tunis so no win for me 😦


1903, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Ah, well.   So, what's the plan from here?  How far are you planning on riding that
juggernaut?


1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well I want to see Russia moves hard on Germany. If they do, well I have a history
of jumping on big openings, y’know? :). Otherwise fleets are heading toward Gibraltar!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Sounds fun!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Also, weirdly, my phone doesn't seem to be updating me with latest messages the way
it should, so I end up seeing these a lot later than I should


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So I tried to move towards a more forward position so I could fight France an d
stab Russia, and *not* fight you, but you’re kinda putting yourself directly in my way,
y’know?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I could’ve kept you out of Ion permanently but that wasn’t what I thought was very
interesting long term. :/

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: Yeah, I wasn't seeing any response from you, so I moved to defend.  We're having
some communication issues based on mis-timing, I think.  Cost us most of a turn, but we
have the weekend to work out a way forward, nu?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sure, understood.  How about this to fix it: Tys S Tun-Wes, Ion-Tun?  You take
back a dot, but we push the position forwards toward Iberia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: are you still not getting any messages from me?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: That could definitely work - and it does advance the positions

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Otherwise this game is going to be a long, unpleasant slog

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I get your messages fine on the computer - it's the phone that seems to not update
properly for some reason.  I just hadn't checked the computer yesterday as I should have 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok, France has told me outright they're wanting to make sure that "Italy is
divided fairly", so I doubt they'll expect me pushing past you toward the west.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Looks that way, yes


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It's too bad we can't find a way to work together to force me out into MAO,
instead of whittling down your defenses season by season.  Once you lose a center, this is
going to crumble really quickly, but I'd totally be willing to try something else, even
though we both didn't do what we said we do last season.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Aye, it's not a *great* plan to just turtle up and try to outlast the juggernaut.
Would love to see or be shown a better option.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah.  For this season, there’s no point in trying to negotiate something: the
risk is too high for you on a fall turn.  But maybe once you’re turtled up and we’re
looking at a slightly safer spring move, we can discuss some way to slingshot me past you


1905, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Absolutely.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: And sorry for slow reply - been traveling

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: No worries - we're on an extended clock right now.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: tap-tap

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Whassup?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Making sure the mic was working now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Heh indeed it is!


Between italy, france:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hi Italy, hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me
for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys  dmz'd if that's ok
with you?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hope you are around. Would be good to chat at least briefly 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Had some technical issues, but the trains are running on time now.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Great, what do you think of my proposal?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Shoot, I was running through the messages so fast I forgot about your proposal by
the time I responded.  Sounds like you might have enough on your hands without me annoying
you in sensitive spaces, so I'm happy to honor such a DMZ

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thanks, let's have a good game!


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: Oh, gdi.  Now I have to tell a truth that sounds like the most cliched lie in the
game: my order update didn't take, I wasn't intending to go to Piedmont.  Yes, I know it
sounds ridiculous, but in this case true.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: Good news is that with your opinion this is more of an opportunity than a disaster
(I'd still rather be in Tyrolia where I'm *supposed* to be) - I can bounce you in Mars to
help keep you in Burgundy, or if you tell me to eff off, I can move back up to Tyrolia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yes, please, go off on adventures elsewhere ...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: Will do!


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What plans do you have for Boh? I can maybe support you into Mun if that is likely
to succeed

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: As awesome as that sounds, I have an Austrian problem to deal with first.
Hopefully diplomatically, we'll see


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Do you need help? I could build a fleet in Mar, maybe


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: You probably have other priorities to attend to, but if can get in position I'm
happy to do anything that frustrates Austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If you can help a push into Munich, then that's one less flank for you to worry
about


1903, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: How are you holding up? It looks bad initially, but Austria will need to disband a
lot in Fall because of Turkey's stab. Not sure how you will come out of it though. Do you
need help in fending off Turkey?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: Oh, I'm fine, and highly amused I wouldn't mind being the mover into Munich,
though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I don't think I'm going for munich this turn but you can give it a shot

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Just as well I didn't see this before the turn processed.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I was thinking the same thing...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Austria dead in one turn, impressive


1903, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: Poor guy - I was really upset we couldn't come to any sort of agreement or
arrangement.


1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So, now that Turkey is going to have 4 fleets in the Mediterranean, what's in the
future?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I doubt they're just going to sit there and let us be.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: War, my friend.  War is in our future.  The faster you can get your fleets into
play, the better it will go for us


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Ok. I'll try to get there.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm also moving Mar to Pie. Hope that's ok with you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: It is what it is.  We needs do what we must

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm sure you expect that I'm coming to attack you and, indeed, Turkey is trying to
set me up against you. But the way I look at it is that if we were to split your CP,
Turkey would still win. I can't let that happen

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Now you can retreat to Tun and get a CP


1904, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: What, pray tell, does CP stand for?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Oh, sorry it's a supply center. I think mixed lingo there


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: I figured you meant support center, I was just curious which language had the
abbreviation as CP. 😃

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Probably some strategy game

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm hoping to get to Mun this round. if you could support Ruh into Mun that would
be appreciated. I can support Tyr in turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Alternatively, pressure R somehow to take away support from Mun.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: We should also come up with a strategy for the mediterranean

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I figure T is going to Very annoying with that fleet, threatening my supply or
supporting a push into Italy. Not quite sure yet how to resolve that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: Good morning

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
italy: Just need to put pressure on R and T, and try to outlast the juggernaut.  At least,
that's my view 🙂


Between germany, austria:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hello Austria! I just want to open up communications, since the two of us will be
working together for most of the game.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Indeed! What's your read on the west thus far?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I haven't heard back from anyone else yet, so I'm assuming it's going to develop
the normal way (me and France fighting in the west while you and Russia fight in the
east). It's critical for us to work together so we aren't steamrolled by either France-
England or Russia-Turkey, so do you want to agree to an alliance right off the bat?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Absolutely. One of my favorite things about this game is that it can reflect real
life history in certain grander strategic considerations, one of which is that, just as
would have been the case, neither Germany nor Austria benefits from an antagonistic
relationship.


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: So given the first move, I think the two of us are in a relatively strong
position. Turkey seems to be focusing more on Russia than you, and England and France are
fighting. Are you going to focus more on Russia or Turkey first? I could try and stop
Russia from taking Scandinavia unopposed, but I'd need assurance first that you're going
to put pressure on them from the south since a move like Warsaw --> Silesia would screw
both of us.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I'm feeling pretty solid about working with Turkey, so Russia is the target for
now.


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: So it seems like Italy's turned on us. I can support Vienna --> Tyrolia next move
if you want

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I'm down. Turkey and I will be able to crack Ionian, and Italy will fall hard.


Between germany, russia:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hey Germany! How’s it going? Looking forward to a fun game!

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Hello! I'm looking forward to a fun game as well. I usually see good things
happen when Russia and Germany work together, so I hope we can both help each other in our
initial plans. I'm assuming you're gonna try and attack Scandinavia first? Let me know
your thoughts, and I look forward to us working well together


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hi Germany - sorry I’m behind the eightball here - got swamped with work

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: But that seems to have worked out well for you so I’m sure you’re not too upset
lol


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: To be honest I was expecting to bounce in Sweden 😅 . From what I've heard England
is gonna move Norway --> St. Petersburg this Spring, just thought I'd let you know.


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Haha word


Between germany, england:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: How's it going Germany just wanted to reach out and get your thoughts on the
game?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hello. I don't have much to go off yet since no orders have been placed, but I'm
hoping we can work together during this game. At least in my experience, Germany and
Britain tend to work well together since we both have the threat of France, and I would be
willing to fend them off while you attack the Russians up north. Let me know your thoughts

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I like to work with people so I'm open to that plan. I figured I would probably
stalemate with Russia for a while while they figured out what was happening down south.


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: It feels like years since we've talked. I've noticed russia hasn't really made
any moves into the north and wanted to know if we could amicably split up the northern
territories?


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: I agree, it seems like Russia is undefended in St. Petersburg. If you let me keep
Sweden you can have whatever other centres you want in Russia.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
england: Alright that's seems reasonable.


Between germany, turkey:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hello Turkey! Just opening up communication

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Comms channel authenticated. Ready to receive transmissions!


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Wait, so why are you attacking both France and England at the same time?  That
seems... dangerous?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I wasn't attacking them, I had non-aggression with them and I had assumed they
would've been preoccupied with Russia at least for a few years. I think I can kick out
their army in Holland, and from there I guess we'll see what happens.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: "non-aggression" doesn't exist in this game, in my experience.  You either have
allies who you work with to divide spoils, or you have people fighting you or about to.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Moving Kie-Hel is a clear act of aggression against England.  Which is fine since
they attacked you at the same time, but if they hadn't, they certainly would now!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I agree, I was mostly relying on the fact that England wouldn't attack France,
Russia, AND me at the same time.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: We'll see how things play out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: England didn't - they *helped* Russia, and given they didn't move to ECH last
season, they've clearly been resolving their issues with France.  I would assume they are
talking a lot at this point.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: They're taken ECH now, and even if the support into Sweden proves Russia and
England have an alliance there isn't much they can do. I agree that I'm in a bit of a
tight spot, but I still have full confidence, especially with you and Austria taking on
Russia and Italy so effectively.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I just gave Russia back their supply center, so they're actually building 2 units
now, fyi...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Shit...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: What you need is an ally you can count on, or you'll be going down quickly unless
the board changes significantly.  Maybe start talking to France?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: already have been

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Heh, talking while punching hard into Bur makes it hard to come up with a good
alliance plan...


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hey there.  Who do you hate most?  Russia, France, or England?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Tbh, they all played well. I'm not mad, it was mostly me who fucked up anyways


Between germany, france:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hello France! Just opening up communication. Hope we have a good game together

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hi Germany, good to talk to you. Were you hoping for particular command centers in
the low lands? I'm considering going for belgium

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Based on what I've heard so far (I have a suspicion England might try for either
Holland or Belgium). I'm gonna go for a pretty conservative start (Kiel --> Denmark,
Berlin --> Kiel, Munich Hold). Do you want to agree that I take Holland and you take
Belgium, then see where we go from there?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: I think that's fine with me.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I'm considering playing fairly aggressive against England and cutting them off at
the pass in 1901, your support for that would be very helpful.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Sure, a strong England is always a threat to me, so I'd be happy to help annoy
them in the North Sea/Scandinavia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Ok, let's see how things play out and I'll be in touch if I need help


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It's unfortunate you decided to move this way because now it gets more difficult
to stop England

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I agree, there's a good chance England can take Belgium this fall, but I'm also
still confident in my position. I'm sorry about your position, that's mostly bad luck.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You had assured me Munich would hold but then I find out it moves to Bur instead.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: It wouldn't have changed the final position anyway since you supported with
Marseille.


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: I would've liked to work together and at least take out england quickly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: But I see you have other plans


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: So, given the moves of England this Fall, it seems clear that they're attacking
both of us. I know I've been... aggressive to you in the past, and I know that chances are
you won't believe me or agree to work with me, but if you hear me out we both can gain
from this (and utterly destroy England in the process). I'll retreat from Burgundy this
Spring, and I'll agree to not invade any more territories of yours until all of England is
destroyed. I'm assuming you're going to build a fleet in Brest, and if you do so and move
Bre --> Eng in the spring it would cut any support that fleet could provide and I can kick
England out of the North Sea. From there I can help support you in to the English Channel
or we could work to convoy an army into the British Isles in the next few years. I hope
you consider.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I am considering it. England in the channel was not great

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hey Austria! How’s it going? Looking forward to a fun game!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: As am I! What direction are you inclined to go? Are you willing to DMZ Galicia?


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Well, I suppose it's probably a mite hypocritical of me to get angry about the
Galicia bounce, but, since you didn't confirm a DMZ, I felt like I had to protect it. Now
that we've seen some tangible move data, what are you thinking?


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m down to work together! I got swamped at work yesterday (I work in politics
lol) and this slipped my mind. Won’t happen again


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: All good. :)


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What’s up Austria?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
austria: Feeling good, I think things are going well.


Between austria, england:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: How's it going Austria, just wanted to say hello.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Doing alright. Haven't heard from many folks yet, so I don't have any concrete
plans yet

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah, I've only heard from you and Russia so far. But to be fair I only just
reached out to anyone.


Between austria, turkey:
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: A/T move fast and break things?  I’m fleets you’re armies, kill Russia quick, let
Italy fart around a few years then carve them up too? Whaddya say?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Solid plan. I'm in.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Cool.  Let's see how our neighbors start talking to see how easiest to proceed
(i.e if I need to gun right after Russia out of the gate [and hence watching my back
against an early agressive Italy], or if I can slip fleets out into the med super early,
because we think Russia might not be as much of an early concern, etc...)


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: This is looking quite promising! I look forward to a productive alliance.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: I have to play some guessing games with Russia - I covered my butt with Arm, but I
was hoping I wouldn’t lose Bla.  But you and I are good, and I’m in position to go “mostly
fleets” and you my army-heavy ally.  What do you think about Italy?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Well, I got him to go to Piedmont, which I didn't expect to work, and having
bounced Russia out of Galicia, none of my centers are under threat, so even if Italy gets
cute, I'm covering Trieste.


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Italy decided to break with me, but, you and I will be able to crack Ionian, so,
we'll make him regret it, eh?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Oh wow, they sure did try to sucker-punch you!  I'm game to go after them, sure,
but if Russia starts actually ordering instead of NMR, taking on both of them will be
doable, but... slow, right?  Maybe we convince Russia to go deal with their northern front
(since there is an E/G clearly)?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: True, if Russia pulls BLA then we can definitely leave them alone for a while.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yep.  Let them keep War/Mos warm for us for a while, and keep those juicy dots out
of English hands. 😉


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Russia is willing to focus north, holding England back, so we can leave them alone
for a while and take out Italy.  Do you want me to support you into Ion, or do you want my
unit to be the mover?  We’ll probably bounce in spring so it won’t matter, but fall we’ll
succeed so we should decide who is the mover.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I'll do the moving.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: sounds good.  You'll have one support in Spring, and then when that doesn't work,
two in the fall.


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Double support of Gre-Ion, right?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That's what I understand the plan to be, yep!


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok, got you into Ion.  Are you attempting to guess a convoy (Nap/Apu?) and want me
to support the fleet, or can I do a supported attack on Ion while you move your fleet
forward (to Tun/Tys/Nap/Adr)?  We should definitely move forward, but we need to
coordinate how to do it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: BTW: I gave Russia Sev back so they could build against Germany, who was getting
way too big. They're building a northern fleet (absolutely no threat to either of us), and
probably either Moscow or Warsaw, depending on if going after Scandanavia or towards
Berlin.  Just fyi.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: And we work to split Italy between the two of us, right?  Tri/Rom for you, Nap/Tun
for me?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: All sounds good to me. My initial train of thought is, you should do a supported
attack on Ionian, while I send my fleet to Apulia. That cuts any chance of that fleet
supporting Venice, and guarantees I get in to Venice. How does that sound to you?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: That sounds good, sure.  If Apu-Nap happens, then you're *in* Apu, which is fine,
as it can support follow-on movements to Venice as well.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: (follow-on meaning when your army in Venice continues on to Rome)


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: If I succeed in pushing you forward out if Ion,   and you’re in Apu and Italy is
in Nap, we can actually convoy to Nap with support from Apu unless Tun goes to Tys, but in
that case Tunis would be open.  Would you want Gre to be the convoy, or could I convoy
from Bul?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I'd be down for you convoying.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: excellent, it's a plan!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Sigh. We coulda been so good together.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah I know.  I got greedy.  :\

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I mean, nothing is set in stone yet. You can take it back.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: It’s true - Bud back to Rum and Ser on to Alb could position for more forward
convoys without needing the rear fleet...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Exactly! My moves will be the same either way, but seeing you do that would be
very encouraging.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Of course if I got stabbed by Russia for Rum at the same time, it would instead
stab you, as I’d just bounce out of Rum and get stuck in Bud!  But I’m sure that’s a risk
you’d be willing to take.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’ll be honest I have to ponder that.  It’s tempting because Italy wouldn’t expect
it at all, and would probably move assuming help from me, which would wreck them further

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Exactly. It'd definitely throw a wrench in what the Italian expects.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: More than expects: they’re already explicitly asking for Ser-Tri to cut that
support

attacking you, which I did per their request in exchange for a different territory. They
have completely gone against what they said to me, which I kind of expected but figured i

Between russia, turkey:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Is the Juggernaut boring? No, I say - it’s simply *retro*!  When executed with
panache, they can even be elegant!  What say you?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Your lively pitch sold me!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Let’s do it!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I suppose the big issue we have to resolve is what we’ll do with the Black Sea.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Rockin'.  Which variant do you want to try?  Talk to our neighbors first and see
how wary and clever they are, before we decide?  We could go all clever [i.e. let one of
us take Bla in Spring '01, so we move super fast], since this game is a) short [only
1910!] and b) low stakes [helping train our future AI Overlords!]...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Could do the slingshot, where you trust me to convoy across and crush your fleet
parked in Rum, so you rebuild up north.  Or we could do the "I trust you" and let you take
Bla while I go to get to Aeg quickly.  Or even the "we both trust each other" where we
trade Con for Sev while your fleet gets out into the Med to actually be useful!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I obviously would feel the most comfortable with the option of you trusting me lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m a super loyal ally but I always am weary of a stab

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: yeah, but if we take risks and build some trust right away in 1901, we can just
*roll*.  But I'm flexible.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah that’s totally true

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Perhaps we dive in with the “we both trust each other” option?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm game.  I usually do that with you in Bla + Ukr + (probably bounce in Gal, but
if you can trick A into letting you in, yay!).  Me in Con + Bul + Arm.  Then fall we make
sure we get your army into Rum, your fleet takes Con, I take Sev so I don't lose a unit
for it (and we can catapult it into action or have you crush it and I rebuild a fleet,
depending on how the board looks).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: That sounds like a great plan to me!!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: The real fun is how we play it in our negotiations with everyone else.  The fun
way is we keep a totally straight face and are all "How dare he take Bla!  I knew I had to
go to Arm just in case!" ... "Ok, I'm telling Turkey that I'm taking Rum with Bla, and I
think he's falling for it :)" ... etc.  Nobody falls for it, but it can be fun to try and
convince them 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Lol yeah for sure!!!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: we need to make sure we keep each other posted on what we say to who

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So we keep our stories straight and don’t set off any false alarms

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: This is going to be so much fun!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Agreed on all points 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What do you recommend for my first moveset?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also diplomatically we should be hoping Italy does not ally with Austria.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Obviously an A/I would be extra annoying for me, and Italy diving right
aggressively into Austria would be icing on the cake, but if we really do move fast and
build early trust, there's actually not much they can do unless the west gets involved
early.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Agreed

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah I’m super down!!!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: First moves: War-Gal, Mos-Ukr, Sev-Bla, StP-Gob.  I do Con-Bul, Smy-Arm, Ank-Con.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Done!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: The stories we tell our neighbors depend on a) whether we can convince Italy to
attack Austria, and/or b) you can convince Austria you're *not* going to Gal [maybe we
convince Austria that Ven-Tri is nearly certain?], so that you end up just walking in.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Gotcha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I've already told Austria I'm wanting to "go all Fleets!" (which is not entirely a
lie, and ostensibly pro-Austrian), which means when they see my first moves, it won't be a
surprise, and may trust me for another season or so as we move the plan forward.  I
haven't heard back from Italy yet.  You're the one most likely to be able to convince
Italy to attack Austria out of the gate ("hey let's divide the east, work together: we
kill Austria first, Turkey next!" etc).  They're less likely to listen to me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Makes sense!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’ll reach out to Italy and keep you posted 😃

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: sounds good.  And if Austria is wary, and wants a bounce in Gal, that's ok too: if
you *tell* Italy there'll be a bounce in Gal, that gives them the opening they need to do
Ven-Tri or Ven-Trl + Rom-Ven 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Smooooth

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Obviously I’m going to be blowing all trust with Austria on the first season

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Does that really matter at all?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We’re basically betting the juggernaut makes quick work of him

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It depends: if they say "I don't trust Italy, I'm ok not going to Gal if you
aren't", then you do blow some trust when you go to Gal.  BUT at the same time you went to
Bla!  Austria and I commiserate around how much a dirty rat you are, you tell them that
you were sure they were lying, and "sorry I didn't trust you, but I'll keep attacking
Turkey, watch, they think I'll park my fleet in Rum, but I'll attack them instead!".  They
could fall for it, as the moves look pretty weird at first.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: If on the other hand, Austria asks for a bounce in Gal, you've blown no trust with
them at all, and "attacked" me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: By fall, when I'm in Sev, and you're in Con and Ukr-Rum, it all depends on where
War ended up.  Gal in spring?  You probably show your cards in the fall with that unit,
yes.  Bounce in spring?  The ruse may not yet be up, unless I need to support you into Rum
(in which case it's clear).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Either way, by the time our Winter '01 builds come out, there'll be no question on
anyone's mind, but by then we're moving fast, and hopefully it's too late. Looks good on
paper at least, right?  🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Sounds good to me!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: only thing remaining is: No E/G!  We need F/G or E/F, as early as possible.  As
much as I can weather a bit of an A/I if I have your help, there's not much I can do to
help you if there's an E/G.  If we can get E and G fighting, the world is our oyster.
I'll open some back channels to see if I can learn anything, but there may not be much to
do other than cheerleading any time we hear someone suggest a Sea Lion, or England asking
you if you'll just divert Gob-Swe to instead do Bal while they convoy to Den, when Germany
ends up in Swe instead of bouncing you out...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah that’s kinda my theatre to handle

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Thanks for all the guidance!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’ll keep you posted with everything I hear!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: yeah I'm sure you can handle your northern front just fine.  I'm just thinkin'
positive, and the ideal Juggernaut is one with fleets in Ion and Nth.  🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Amen 😃

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well the *ideal* Juggernaut is when Russian NAO S  Turkish Wes-MAO succeeds - a
boy can dream, can't he? 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yesssss

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We’ve got til 1910

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Aye, there's the rub!  We'll give it the ol' college try.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: (gotta speak in cliches sometimes, to help train this NLP engine we're giving
training data too 😉 )

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Austria asked if I am willing to DMZ Gal

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Right, ok, so this is interesting.  You can agree, and then go there anyways, and
you just walk in.  Then you're in the weird position where it *looks* like you just
successfully sneak-attacked both of us.  You'll get some fun messages from people all over
the board! 🙂  But the position will be really good for us.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Austria DMZ'ing Gal usually means they're covering Tri, so if you can convince
Italy to go Ven-Trl, Rom-Ven, Austria is in for a *very* short game, and it'll also be too
late for Italy to realize I'm flooding into the med.  So that'd of course be ideal.


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: You get any feel from Italy?  If they were to turn and do pie-trl, ven-tri, that’d
be awesome, but I sense more of a “pile on France” vibe in the west...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: So apparently Austria is covering Tri, so if we’re really doing this, going for
Gal should succeed, so that should definitely happen!


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: you didn't move?!?!?  that... kinda blows.  It hurt you more than me, but tbh - I
was looking forward to doing our clever plan... :\

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: we can repair this if you disband that southern fleet - as it won't get out into
the med quick enough to really be as clever as we'd been planning it to be.  In fact,
maybe we can turn this to our advantage?  Austria will never see us working together
coming, now, and will get embroiled in an A/I war, and I swing my army down into the
balkans while you retake Sev and we're back to the races... it could work.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Are you still in this game?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hey man I’m so so so so sorry

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I work in politics and I’ve been overwhelmed with work

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I submitted orders to disband my southern fleet

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So I have you to blame for Iowa?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: HAHAH

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yes exactly lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Not a good negotiating tactic, IMO ;p

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hahah so basically

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m probably not going to be as active as I had hoped, but I will consistently
make whatever move sets you recommend and won’t miss another turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Once again, I am so sorry to have dropped the ball here

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It’s cool.  We’ll come up with something. Just a game! 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Thanks Turkey 😃

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: And like I said I totally trust you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So here’s a plan, given we have to change things a little, and requires less of
your time: Italy and Austria are at war, but E/G are working together, so we pivot this
into a loosely coupled RAT alliance: Austria and I head against Italy, and you make sure
to hold off the north, and Austria will help if Germany comes on land as well (I don’t
think they will: France is hard enough, and Germany taking on France and Russia at the
same time has... a lot of poor historical precedent).  I’ll see if I can take Rum and let
you grab Sev back so you can build north, but we’ll come up with something!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Sounds good! I’m in!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Cool. I’m building F Smy and A Con.  Will get you detailed plans after we see the
builds.  Good luck fixing democracy ;p

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Lol thanks turkey! doing the Lord’s work haha


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok, I'm moving down to Rum, so you should go GoB-StP, Ukr-Mos and either hang
tight with War, or really lock down StP by doing War-Lvn.  If you were playing more
heavily, I'd suggest the opposite: tell England you'll not even contest StP if they take
it with a fleet instead of an army, and instead throw all your armies at Germany, or go
with me into eating Austria.  But that requires actually convincing England to go for it,
and you don't got time for that shit right now.  So locking down StP should help, if you
just want to move the pieces around the board. 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Done

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Moved to Lvn to be safe


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Thoughts on this turn?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: GoB-StP, Lvn-StP, Mos-Sev, hopefully build F StP(nc)! 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I don’t need a build this year, you do

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: In some sense it’s a better RT than we’d planned, if it works!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: England wants to help me take Sweden - should I beleive him?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Thanks for Sev my friend!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think yes he could lie, but I told him he should work with you there.  I suggest
offering the support, but telling him you’ll naturally have to cover StP in case he’s
lying.  Then the safe bet is Lvn covers StP (no northern fleet build 😦 ), and build A War.
The risky bet is bluff E out of StP, leaving it open for a build while you support the
attack on Swe.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ill play it safe and protect stp

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Take what you can get

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If I can get two builds this year I’ll definitely improve my odds of surviving lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well if you think this build is likely, you could save Sev for next year: self
bounce Lvn and Mos in StP, and take Swe with GoB, and build a northern fleet - maybe South
Coast to not piss off England.  Then next year you take back Sev, and build *another*
northern fleet!  That’d be pretty baller

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: Why do I need a northern fleet?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Because you’re the only one in the east who can build them, and StP is extremely
easy for the west to take, and then hold forever

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Northern fleets are the only way you and I are over the traditional stalemate line

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So you need them sooner rather than later

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And thus they make you indispensable to any eastern alliance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Makes sense!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: How about I just trust england and hold in Lyn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Then I get two builds which will help me expand and a northern fleet

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I trust england to want to hurt Germany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: That works too!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: Sweet!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Rockin, E/G war is what we really need.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Exactly!!


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: nice work, two builds, you're back in business!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm pondering fillet'ing Austria.  Are you busy fighting Germany, or are you
interested in taking a little part in that?  With this A/I war, I've got the position to
mostly do it myself, but if you had A War and wanted to take part in maybe getting Vienna
for yourself, you could use that to fuel your further expansions while I gobble most of
the rest of Austria and push through the med...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I could down

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: *be

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Coolio.  Build that northern fleet to keep some northern play, and that unit in
War (and if Austria asks, just say it's because you *just* took a center from Germany, and
are prepping for what that will clearly lead to).  And then Gal is the direction it should
clearly go, with the only thing left is timing: we both go simultaneously and it's
curtains for the hapless archduke!  Board situation may even call for a spring stab for
position with fall being utterly ruthless:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I walk into Bud, Ser, Bul, you into Gal, fall move I support you into Vie and
Italy back toward Tri while attacking Gre, and... *pop* from 5 down to 1 or 2.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: then I build a turkish armada, and even having given Italy a build, it doesn't
help them, and you're fueled and ready to pick which of E/G to poke at (first) 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: but happy to hear other suggestions (as long as they all involve me getting Yuge
;P )

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Your builds are in, right?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: My moveset right now is

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: A Lvn - Pru A Sev - Ukr F Stp/nc- BAR  F Swe H A War - Gal

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: How does that sound?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: That sounds great, except for one possible question: do you want to coordinate
with Germany against England?  StP S Swe-Nwy ?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I don’t have much of a relationship with either

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: But engl helped me with Sweden

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So the thing I notice on this board is that you and I are the only ones thinking
about “alliances”.  Everyone else is talking about extremely short term arrangements.
“Gunboat with a little bit of talking”, basically.  There is no FG alliance, it’s just
that they’re both fighting England... for now.  It’s odd (to me).  I’m all for dynamic
play, but you never get anywhere in this game if you only go it alone.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Your moves sound fine, but just don’t treat England as an ally - they merely
helped you so their attack on Holland would lead to an enemy who wasn’t simultaneously
building another unit.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah for sure

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Just all things being equal I rather hit the guy who I haven’t worked with before
hahaha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Then maybe F StP(sc) might have been more useful.  Next build! 😉

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Why didn’t Germany take Hol? How did england hold it with no support? Am I missing
something?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Bel S Hol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Got it! Thanks!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Long term how should be dispose of the remaining powers? I think Germany is the
clear next target for me and Italy for you?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: Then I’ll be strong enough to push England off the mainland and hit them by sea
from the north and France won’t be much of a problem? The only thing we have to fear is
any strong alliances between the remaining players.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Position is key: you need to get well pushed over the stalemate line, and I'll be
focussing on getting a bit past Italy to France, in fact (hence my new fleets)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Makes sense. Munich is my main goal for next year, Kie as well ideally.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yep.  I may be able to help with Munich.  And we may need to balance centers - me
owning Munich longer term helps me agaianst France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: For sure. I have no problem with that as long as I keep growing every year.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: In the short term it’s a good hold for me as I cripple Germany.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: totally agreed.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: You may want to just leave Vie behind and focus on Germany, it's not like Italy
could hold it even if they took it.  Vie-Trl, Gal-Boh, War-Sil is a continuing brutal
charge toward Munich.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah that’s my thought too. At this point it isn’t worth it in my mind to work
something out with Italy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Don't worry about them, they'll be busy dealing with me 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

Stp/sc - BOT F Swe S Nwy A Vie - Tyr A War - Sil

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Let me know what you think!!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m a bit concerned about leaving Vie open.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: How about this: I will cover Vie for you: Bud-Vie, Ser-Bud, Bul-Ser.  If Italy
goes to Vie, we’ll bounce and you’re safe.  If I just walk into your center, I have three
units on Tri for fall to guarantee it, and Vie will be the mover so you will keep your
center. In short: I’ve got your back :). Just remember to pay me back later when I need a
similar favor 😉

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: For sure! I’m pretty comfortable with this alliance. The game automatically ends
in 1910 so there isn’t really enough time for an outright victory. But working together we
should have enough time to whipe everyone else off the board. I’m down to set it to a two
way draw once we’ve knocked out everyone else!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Agreed on all accounts.  I don't even think we can truly eliminate *everyone*
else.  But we can try 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If we have to go three way so be it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: As we get further along, we can see if other powers need eliminating, or if they
can make themselves useful while being small enough / positioned properly to not be a
threat in any way.  I’m not focused very much on the draw size - I care more about
“proximity to a win” in a more abstract sense than number of remaining players.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Makes sense to me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

this winter

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: *ruh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What moves do you recommend?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I desperately need a build this turn to built a northern fleet. Perhaps even
abandoning Nwy is a fall back

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Lemme look more closely at the board and get back to you after lunch!

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Deal!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think you need to stop the Nwg-Bar move, by doing Nwy-Bar.  At the same time, we
need to just give you Tri so you can build another northern fleet.  We can give it back to
me next year and if necessary you just disband a rearguard army to make up for it if
you’re not picking up another build somewhere else.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: That makes a world of sense to me. Thank you so much!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: A Ber S Sil - Mun A Boh S Sil - Mun F BOT - BAL F Nwy - BAR A Sil - Mun F Swe S

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Updated moves

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Also, since you probably won’t get Mun, move War-Pru to make sure it gets to the
front lines.  It’s not quite as good as Sil if you got Mun now, but you can still shuffle

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What about war - Gal?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: It’s slow to get to the lines

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: That way I can hold vie and take tyr

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Pru can also get convoyed to Swe

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Tru

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Lemme think about your idea- it may be better?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Gonna move Swe- Nwy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok looking at the next few seasons, War-Gal is too slow.  War-Pru, and I’m giving
you Tri now, for your build, but basically right after, you should be doing Boh S Tri-Trl,
and you’re right smack on where you need to be with all of Trl, Boh, Sil, Pru, and Ber.
As you do Tri-Trl, I’m following into Tri to push on Venice and Piedmont.  Plus  like I
said, Pru also gives you the option of convoy to Swe so your fleets are more free to move
around while an army garissons your Scandinavian holdings (and even do Bal+Swe attacking
Den)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: A Ber S Sil - Mun A Boh S Sil - Mun F BOT - BAL F Nwy - BAR A Sil - Mun F Swe -
Nwy A Vie - Tri A War - Pru

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Does this look good?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Perfect.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Oh crap, I think I had old orders in there for Tri

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hopefully it caught my update in time

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I bet it did

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Great catch

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: It seems to have a 15 minute grace so you literally were not a moment too soo.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: No shit! It worked! And everything went smoothly!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What a lucky save

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: And two builds will make it easy to pass tri back to you as I love my army north.
I should take at least Den next turn so I won’t have to disband

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: *move

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So I suggest build just the fleet, and hold the other for next year in case you
need another fleet. We have a solid army marching forward already.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Meh I’ll have to look at the board in the morning but my inclination is to take
the extra army and if I have to disband it I have to disband it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But if you *dont* need to disband it, you won’t be able to build another fleet if
you stay even after losing Tri but winning Den.  But yeah let’s chat about it after
retreats.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah you’re right just looked at the map holding the build this turn so I can lock
up fleet #5 next year seems to be the move

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: I feel great about where we’re at. We’re pushing past the stalemate line

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Way past.  I’m in Wes, also, which is good as it keeps France from sending Fleets
to help England

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So suggestions, after builds are in: Swe S Bal-Den, Bal-Den, Nwy-Nth (guarantees
Den succeeds), StP-Bar (making room for that next build).  I think doing a similar risk
with Munich might be warranted: Mun-Kie, Ber supports that, Boh S Tri-Trl, Pru-Sil.  Then
you likely pick up Kie but lose Munich, but can easily retake Mun in the fall.


1904, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: oh wow, nevermind, I didn't realize England already vacated Nth.  Must revise
thoughts...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Let me know who you come up with! I submitted a build for a northern fleet and
that’s it


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So in the north, F Nwy S StP-Bar is a lock, and protects Nwy and keeps England
locked out of Bar, completely.  With respect to Swe/Den, taking Den with Swe leaves Bal in
place, which is great for taking on / protecting Kie/Ber.  However, that also brings up
another great use of F Bal: convoys.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: F Bal C Pru-Den, F Swe supports it, and either A Mun-Kie (with support from Ber)
or A Ber-Kie (with Boh supporting Mun) ensures that Denmark is captured.  The only counter
to that is something I doubt they're clever enough for: Bur + Ruh S Kie-Mun, Hol S Den-Kie
- abandon Den in exchange for taking Mun and saving the Danish army by putting it in Kiel.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: If you go with Mun-Kie, then use Boh to support Tri-Trl.  I'll cover Vie again
with Bud.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Our situation with your Vie/Tri centers is tricky: once you recapture Trl, and I'm
in Tri, we can press on them, but as long as we need to worry about protecting Vie/Tri
from falling into their hands *and* from falling into *my* hands (unintentionally - to
keep them out), it'll slow us down, and possibly rob you of the ability to get that last
needed northern fleet.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: For now, I'm doing the Bul-Ser-Bud-Vie choo-choo train, as well as taking Adr and
moving Gre-Alb.  If you decide to use Boh S Mun, you probably still want Tri-Trl, but that
unit may get wrecked by Ven S Trl-Tri.  I'll take back Tri in the fall, and your army
there would have been evaporated in that case, but net effect is it won't change your
"available builds" count, and if you stay even elsewhere, you'll still have another F StP
to pull out.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: My southern army is a short term problem that will resolve itself in the next year
or so as you (and France potentially?) crush Italy. If it must be disbanded and
reincarnated as a final northern fleet, so be it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Here is what I have set at the moment;

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: F BAL C Pru - Den A Ber - Kie A Boh S Mun A Mun S Ber - Kie F Nwy S Stp/nc - BAR A
Pru - Den F Stp/nc - BAR F Swe S Pru - Den A Tri - Tyr

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: In the long term I would like to hold on to Vie, which I hope you’re comfortable
with.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Once Italy is broken and I’m hitting England from the north if for whatever reason
I lose Vie it will be a very easy target for reconquest by a Warsaw built army

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Let me know what you think of the orders I have submitted and then it you don’t
mind sending me yours I would appreciate it (no need tho)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Your orders look fine.  Since Tri-Trl is moving unsupported and Italy can
counterattack, I definitely need to be ready to crush them in Tri in the fall.  We really
didn’t help outlet position with this mildly entangled mess in Austria.  As for you
keeping Vienna long term: it is all about moving our alliance forward.  Currently you need
the builds, so I got you into Vie and then Tri.  You’re fighting three enemies.  But as
you focus on just two, and I come into contact with France, I’ll need the builds just as
much, so we’ll just keep track of where we need those builds to come from as we press
forward!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: As for moves, it may make sense for me to attack Tri with support now, and if you
dislodge, retreat to Vie, which both protects Vie, and allows you to use that to attack
Trl.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So I propose A Bud s Ser-Tri, Ser-Tri, Gre-Alb, Bul-Gre

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hey Turkey you are totally right and I am absolutely happy to shead those builds
to you to help you move the ball forward in the south

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Very good point.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If I pick up two this turn then I won’t need either center! I just want that
northern fleet haha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Agreed: keeping England on the defensive and keeping all of their armies locked up
is key.  The hardest part will be the island and the French home centers.  But once
England starts losing centers they’ll crumble.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What if I just move A Tri - Vie?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Then you can support me into Thr in the fall?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yep that works too

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Makes more sense to me!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Done.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: The only reason to hit Trl now is to cut any support Trl might give to an attack
on Mun.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hmmm

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Good point

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: In that case hitting Tyr is the superior move. I can still retreat to vie
potentially

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yep that was what I was thinking.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: Lit

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I appreciate running my moves by you. Working with you this game has taught me a
lot and made me a stronger player!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But losing Munich in the spring is not a catastrophe- retreat to Sil, and you
already have huge pressure on Kie to ensure you’d get Mun back quickly. It’s a small
gamble either way.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I agree but I rather not loose ground there

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Thanks.  It’s been super fun so far. 🙂  I haven’t played online in years, but used
to play f2f with the world’s greatest players (no exaggeration).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Woah!! That’s amazing.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I played a bit in high school and now I’m getting back into it with this study.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Nice!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Wow, that went really well, again. 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So I'm retreating to the Gulf of Lyon, because hey, I can. 🙂  That single lone
fleet behind enemy lines will wreck *havoc* on France's ability to concentrate: it will
take both of their fleets, *and* one of their armies, to cover all their bases in Spa and
Mar (imagine what you'll be able to do once you can slip a single fleet into NAO? :] ).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: You should be able to hold Munich with the same kind of moves as this past season
(Ber-Kie, Boh S Mun, except this time, Bal and Den can also support the attack on Kie,
while Swe S Den and Bar S Nwy).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Meanwhile, Trl can help you hang onto Tri while I move out into Ven: Trl S Tri-
Ven, Adr S Tri-Ven, and I think I'll get in.  Which would put you up one for Den, and you
already had one in the bag, so you could build A War and F StP.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: My moves in Italy are going to be some fun guessing games.  I can convoy from
Greece to Apu or guess that Italy will think I'd do that, and try instead to be tricky and
dodge past them into Naples.  But are they the sort of person willing to risk a home
center on a fall move?  I'm guessing not.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: and it's not like they didn't order moves - they just ignored helping England?!?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: the only sad thing is you could've taken Nwg (which is kinda crazy!),  not that
you could've guessed they'd support Nth unnecessarily instead of Nwg...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Very true. Do you see a path for me to take it kn 2016? Once my fleets break out
in the north, England’s days are numbered

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: England will have to disband something which is great.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: well, you're building F StP(nc), so you can start sliding Nwy-Ska, Bar S StP-Nwy,
and maybe trying to slide Swe-Den somehow.  Then you'll have enough force to make England
choose between Nwg and Nth

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Working with France right now will take some pressure of me in the short term and
help me put England to bed for good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So IMO, if we want things to move faster, yes, we offer France whatever they want
in exchange for them turning on England, and at the same time, be ready to offer England
to help them punish the one who stabbed them (France).  So offer Holland to France,
totally!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing

France for the time being.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: You can even tell them "darn, Turkey keeps going after you - maybe we should work
together against them once we crush England a little?", so they trust you even more.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: As for what England is doing with the fleets - they're not telling me, and I know
what *I* would do, but I don't know what they would do.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So I'm letting France take Tunis, by the way.  So if you decide to help them with
Hol, they'll get two builds this year.  Just FYI.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: One nasty approach is too give France support to take Holland in the spring, but
then follow in and take it from them in the fall, and they don't get a build at all, and
yet have already pissed off England, and they can't work together anyways :]

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: This is what I have but I’m not sure what the plan is for France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So, I have news!  England is pissed at France (duh!) and wants to attack them. I
suggested that I could get you to give them a season or two of buffer to go do that.  We
could try it for a season and see if they really do it?  For one season move towards
France: to Hel!  And England goes to Nao and Ech

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hmm maybe

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: We don’t need to actually *do* that - I just told him that.  You could do both:
move Den-Hel, Swe-Den, Nwy S Bar-Nwg

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: F BAR - NWG A Ber - Kie A Boh S Mun F Den - NTH A Kie - Den A Mun H F Nwy S BAR -
NWG A Pru - Ber A Sil S Mun F SKA S Den - NTH F Swe - SKA

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: How does this look?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If you have something better I’m happy to do it!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I think most is good, but Den-Hel, Swe-Den would get you in position to crack the
French position as well.  England is running at France right now, you don't even need to
use all of your strength on them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: Dope

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Gotta get my armies out there

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Kie-Den is slick: sets you up to convoy to Yor 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Exactly 😝

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So for the fall, let France and england fight it out?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: It’s so so so tempting to nab two English supply centers, but I know letting
England keep France busy will help you break him in the Mediterranean

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: We simply crush them.  They're already fighting.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: Big big big agree

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Two way victory

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: It's going to be hard to literally kill them both in 3.5 game years, but we can
try! 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Idk I honestly think I’ve I just blitzkreiged rn I would roll over both of em

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: What’s going on with your army in bud?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Just in case you pick up too many dots before I get one (given the way Hol, Bel,
Edi, Lon look), I use that to take Vie to keep us even, while the other armies and fleets
keep sliding towards Portugal.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Okay that’s fine. I’m thinking of turning on France and taking Hol.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Once Hol falls that whole front will start to crumble rapidly. Meanwhile next year
I can scoop up 2 English supply centres like taking candy from a baby.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yep, taking Hol means Ruh falls which opens up the delicious wines of Burgundy!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hahaha exactly! And while having england and France fight is great conceptually
(if this game didn’t end in 1910), I think I’ve already got everything I wanted from that
conflight (naval control of the north)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: and its not like they'll stop fighting, frankly.  England knows he's dead, and
wants to take France down with him for the stab.  We are simply obliging his desire!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Epic! Well I will hold off on attacking England for the time being.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah, if you start with Hol, and let him keep his fleets through winter, he'll
have them for attacking France all of 1908, and during *that* year you can snatch some
english dots while he's cracking MAO for me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Absolutely!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: And why stop with just hol? I can convoy A Den  to Belgium as well.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Oh shit, you're right! 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Lol France just asked me to turn on you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Do you want me to play along or just ignore it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It might be entertaining to play along.  Be unsure, but let him “convince you”
it’s a good idea.  It may make him even less likely to see Bel coming!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: The juggernaut train just keeps-a-rollin! 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Bless 🙏🏼

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Since Ber - Kie will succeed, and Mun-Ruh won't, maybe Sil will get closer to the
action by going to Ber, and have Boh-Mun, and I can support Boh-Mun with Trl?  I already
have another unit which can support my attack on Pie.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
turkey: let me know.   I can use Tus for other attacks on Lyo if you don't need Trl to
support Boh-Mun

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I updated Sil - Ber

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: I don’t think boh - mun would work

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I just have boh supporting mun

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Okay dude really

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m very interested to hear an alternative explainatuon for your moveset.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Man I really enjoyed working with you. I thought it would be so fun to have a nice
game where we work together and score a two way victory.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
turkey: It’ll still probably end up that way, frankly.   Just seeing England roll over
like a sick jellyfish and France continue to hold me off while crumbling to you... I
figured worst case scenario: you still kill the entire west, I rule the east.  You realize
you’re *still* closer to Gibraltar than I am!  So yeah, I didn’t think you were *planning*
to screw me, I just looked at the map and saw: what if England and France just *gave him*
the win?  Can’t I just cover my ass so even if he grows by 4 next year, I’m still ok?  And
seriously: watch how it goes: even with this move, there is nothing I or they can do to
stop you from crushing that whole side of the board.  And in 3 full game years? They’ll
*still* both be dead!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah I guess, I mean we’ll played I suppose

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But I am not trying to blow you some lame line: do what you gotta do!  But it the
map doesn’t change: you already have complete domination over the west on your own, and I
am not jealous- you did awesome.  I’m just trying to play a little catch up, since France
opted to just slow me down and let you have England, instead of take them out and risk me
catching the unawares.  Totally in their right, of course.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah for sure but if you felt that way you could have asked.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
turkey: “Could you please slow down killing them so brutally so I can catch up?”  That’d
be some pretty sad shit!  If I deserved to be doing better, I’d have outplayed France’s
tactics or convinced them to somehow be somewhere else.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But yeah I could have proposed “you west, me east?” and you probably would have
set some conditions but been ok with it.  I’ve seen how you play.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah for sure I would  have been happy and willing give you a few of my centers to
keep parity

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Yeah you have before.  We both have. I guess I figured it’d end up that way
anyway, and “it’s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission”, as lame as that sounds.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I guess

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So I’ll totally deserve it if I get stuck in a mere 3-way draw when I coulda
cruised into a clean 50/50 split with a game long ally.  You can say I told you so, and
it’ll be my own damn fault.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah nuts haha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We’ll see what happens

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Alright, so, I'm kind of tangled with Germany. England is my temporary friend. I
think they also want to hit Germany.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I think England may have seen Stp as a move of opportunity, I'm not sure, since if
they had moved to Swe it would've been a lot better, honestly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I can work with you guys


1906, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think it's clear that it's just a matter of time before you overrun England's
position. Would you mind divvying up the remains?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hey France! Appreciate you not hitting me last year.  I could be down for
something like that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What’s your relationship like with England? Until last turn I was under the
impression you guys were allies

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: We were/are, yeah. But Englands position is not tenable. E made some mistakes when
we were mopping up G and it just took too long.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Makes sense. Aside from me and turkey you’re clearly the strongest and it works
for me to work with you so I can just focus on England

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What are you thinking in terms of this season?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I wish my fleets were available

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ugh same

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm thinking of siding with E for another season and then going for a stab in
Holland in Fall

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah that makes sense

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’d have to look at it again in the morning but I might be down to help you out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Clearly turkey and I are allies so I’m not tryna step on any toes

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Fair enough

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’d be very interested in what moves england is planning on making

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'll see if I can put a fleet in Mao to go for Lvp while you take the east side

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah that would be legit.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m down to support you into Holland

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Fighting you over it would be a pain for both of us

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Could you get me intel on England’s next moves?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm reaching out but we'll see if they're still tuned in to the game

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Gotcha wouldn’t be shocked if they check out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: This study is so much fun

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Like getting paid to play this game, what can beat that?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That is awesome, yeah. Though I wish I could play diplomacy in a short burst 😄

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Turkey seems to be taking things very seriously

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah I feel like he’s hardcore

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: Maybe we can look at him after we build up strength by taking out england

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I've played Turkey a couple of times but never got Russia to ally with me. It's
quite strong

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: At the same time, I've never seen such an eagerness to cooperate either

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm guessing Turkey imposed DMZs on Vie/Bud etc?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: It’s not overly formal

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Mostly we had a common interest in taking out Austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: And I skipped a turn early on and needed an ally to survive

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Ah yes I remember that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: The Sev disband probably helped with the mutual trust 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah, I'll move out to Lvp now and see if we can push through the fleets

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

England’s baby we’re chilling

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We can talk about how to divid it up. We definitely should make sure we both get
builds. we’re good to pause aggression on our front on the continent?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Do you have a will to team up on Turkey at this point? I can't stop T by myself


1907, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Lol nice!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: How are you holding up with the craziness?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm fine, just gotta keep social contacts going even though they're virtual

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: But the board state is giving me a headache

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Join the club

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Has turkey reached out to you at all?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think, given our position we can't survive if we don't work together

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: 100%

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Like, I don't think you can protecct War,Mos & Sev by fall

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: For me, I don't know about Spain & Por.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Nah. I think the only one of my original supply centers I can save is StP

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I think we have to put England to bed quickly so we can turn all our sights on
Turkey.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Luckily it's somewhat independent

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Though it seems likely turkey would reach out to E, perhaps

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah of course.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I haven’t spoke much with him since the early game.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: At the end of the day we have to just survive three years.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah he just wants to take you on

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I don’t think he’ll be useful against England and I rather put one front to bed so
we can focus on the real enemy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: *against Turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: With a tightly coordainated strategy I think we can at least force a 3 way draw,
perhaps even regain some ground.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It looks like you can get Lvp and Edi this turn.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yup.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I could chase after Mao or go for Lon, what do you think?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m more worried about the fleet than the army

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I think one rouge English fleet could be a hastle whereas the army is trapped on
the mainland and will probably get disbanded anyway

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I also think we need to go on the offensive in the balkans before he gets more
builds

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: I can support Pie to Tyr which should break his line

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah, I'll be withdrawing from Ruh to cover my CP from Mao then and potentially
get through to italy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m hoping he stretches himself a little too thin taking my home centers and opens
up Central Europe for us to dive in

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Perfect. We can’t let him get out of the Mediterranean

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: As we move forward, once I start taking centers in the balkans I would be happy to
return hol and other centers to keep you strong

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Actually could you support mun to tyr?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: That would be a faster way for me to deploy my armies away from you and get them
at the front lines ASAP

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'd be happy to, but I expect Pie to get attacked

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So don't count on it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: From venice with support from Tyr.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: And Tus

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Gotcha that doesn’t shock me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m gonna support with Boh as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Fair enough. If you do I think I Pie can live

russia: A Ber - Pru A Boh - Sil A Den - Kie F HEL - NTH A Hol - Ruh A Kie - Mun A Mun -

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Here’s my update orders

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Looks like I don’t think we can take Tyr so I’m just repositioning my guys to get
them as close to the front as possible.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I might be able to reclaim war or at least slow him down by contesting it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: NAO can go to Lvp directly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If we put england to be and I can get my fleets into the med he’s in trouble. That
being said, it’s much easier for me to just shed supply centers to you and disband my
fleets once’s england is toast

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’ll do it in the fall

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I want to get my fleets out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sure

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So if you don't attack Tyr, there's a real chance my Pie army cannot retreat

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Oh no

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What do you think is best?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Not the end of the world of course.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What if you play defensively, move Mar to Spain supported by Wes and move pie to
Mar supported by bur?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I can support Pie - Mar with Bur and then support Mar - Spa with Wes to make room

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Better to lose the buffer territory than to lose the army.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hahaha okay so we’re on the same page lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: With a bit of luck, england goes to Por, and I can destroy their fleet by fall

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Epic

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Can you move Ruhr to Belgium or elsewhere to make room for me to deploy holland
closer to the front?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Alright, seems good.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Will do.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Btw, if you want to get Nwy to Stp/sc in spring then you could make it just barely
in time.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m looking into move Den thru Scandinavia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Might be faster

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: In which case you could leave Ruhr where it is

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Nah I think I’m just gonna park the fleet in StpN and then focus on break past the
stalemate line in Central Europe while he over extends himself taking my centers

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So if you can move Ruhr that would help

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Alright, moving Ruh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Maybe you can just take Mun

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: That gets that army to the front instantly and if someone gets a build it should
be you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Since you can drop fleets right into the med

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Your naval front is gonna be where this is won or lost

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If he can take full control of the med we’re toast

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I rather have you take mun than keep that army trapped behind our lines all year

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I'm fine with that too but what will you do with Mun?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Move it east?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I think the pivotal factor this year is seeing if he spreads himself thin enough
for us to punch through his line in Central Europe. If we can start eating tho supply
centers and put him on the defense we will come out ahead.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

serves no purpose

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Playing defense

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Against what? It takes at least 3 turns for T to reach it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: In the mean time your fleet is useless

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hmm what do you suggest?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hold in Nwy for one or two turns. (or use it to support Hel - NTH)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: It’s an army in lon so they can’t just get

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Updated

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Oh yeah, it is... Lol I forgot. It just seems so illogical

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah it def is

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We just gotta put him to bed, hopefully this turn.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: In the fall we’ll try to push your army in Mun to either Tyr or if not move it Bur
if possible. If I can keep it to only losing one fleet that would be ideal. Two night mess
things up a bit. I will tho in the future shed supply centers to you to build fleets. Once
england is gone I can probably shed two or three pretty easily.


1908, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Okay that went well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I don’t thinkwe’ll be able to push thru the line this fall. Can you move Mun to
burg and then bur to gas

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Looks like we should have punched Tyr but oh well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Fine with me to move Mun back but I want to move Bur to Pic instead to cover Bel
and Bre against England, just in case

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Makes sense to me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: actually, can you attack mun with support, then I retreat to bur? I can poke Tyr
so it can't support an attack to boh maybe

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: also, T may think longer that we aren't working together

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: unless you need Kie

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah that’s true

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: RAther lose Mun that Kie

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It's guaranteed to win if I attack Tyr

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: He doesn't have a 2-attack on Mun

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Really?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I meant your 2-attack on Mun

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm not too sure what to disband at this point

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Bel? seems obvious but Eng will take Bre. And then I cannot take Hol in the future
as easily (unless I pull back Mar)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I was thinking of you taking Lon and then, as a trade, me taking Hol. Since you
can't use builds atm anyway.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I feel like I need all my fleets in the Mediterranean so it must be an army

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Totally happy to do any trade that works best for our alliance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I’m so excited that you broke through his line in the balkans

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Depending on how annying England plans to be, would you mind advancing to the
english channel so you can support me in kicking out an english fleet?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yes

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: How do you see the situation develop from Tyr?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: We can pressure both War and Vie but that doesn't guarantee success as long as Mos
is there

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: True

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Not sure. My thinking would be to get some guys behind his lines and force him to
push back. I agree that Vie and War should be the main targets.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We have to make sure he doesn’t get another center

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: That’s the only thing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If he gets 18 he wins. we need to hold the line and force a 3 way draw.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Can't you bounce off stp?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Bar <-> Lvn, while the fleet moves away. Then You can build there if you have one

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I don’t have a build hahah

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: And most likely won’t get one 😦

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Well, if E gives up you will?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thing is, I have to gamble to not lose a center

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah that’s true.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: How likely is that tho?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Either T moves into Spa, or into Mar.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: And I don't know which

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Spain supports Mar, Portugal supports Spain

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That's not enough, if F wes -> spa, then support is cut

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Damn we might be toast

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If we had thought about this before I could have moved Mun to Burg to defend

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Might be, as in 50/50

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Well, do that now. But we need to pressure War

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: in the next turn, if we live.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Turkey is smart he’ll lock it up.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Okay this might work

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Tyr hits Pie

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Spain hits lyo

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Braking the support wherever it comes from

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Saving Mar

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

russia: I think my plan will work

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: why does Tyr attack Pie? Just for defense in the future?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I wouldn't lose it unless Lyo attacks

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We don’t know who is going to be the support and who is going to be the attacker

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So it's not definite...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I can support Tyr into Pie. Even though that's kinda useless

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Can we talk through longer term strategy tomorrow? I’m about to call it a night.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yea, but my point still stands that we need a center somewhere to compensate

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: How do we get one?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Perhaps War

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah that’s our best shot. You want me to throw everything I have at it?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello Turkey, just wanted to say hello and hope we have a fun game!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: How dare you!  I declare war!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Shit.  Was I supposed to click “I’m lying” or “I’m telling the truth” for sarcasm?
This is hard! 😉

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
england: So these brave young Englishmen begin their march across the continent to wage
war on a country or possibly a bird?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: good question on the sarcasm, may throw of the numbers at the end

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’m going to go with “am I intending to deceive” as the spirit of the law

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I did the same

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Thankfully they explicitly mention it’s ok to have the infamous “It was true when
I said it!” excuse

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: maybe they've run into this issue previously

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Among diplomacy players? Never.


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hey are you doing anything with russia? I've tried reaching out to them and they
haven't responded back to me so I'm assuming they're plotting something.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well they definitely are plotting lots of things.  I covered myself with Arm, but
them taking Bla will require some guesswork on my part.  Hopefully I can convince them to
just take Rum with the fleet...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright, them not responding to me and pushing north makes me think they don't
really have any desire to work with me. Just figured I'd talk to you to see if we could
coordinate so russia isn't able to easily push both fronts.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: How did they push north?  3 units went south, the only northern move they did is
StP-GoB.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: From what I can tell, Russia was worried that Austria and I were ganging up on
them (at least that’s what Austria tells me, and the excuse Russia gave for both War-Gal
and Sev-Bla).  So I’m game to try and out guess them with you, but I think Russia is
looking for an ally anywhere.  If you offered an alliance with them (real or fake) they
would probably take it.  For example if you offered to convoy to Den while they drop into
Bal, they’d probably do that, setting off an R/G war (not sure if you want that, but you
could).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Seems like you and Germany are already teaming up on France, so you can probably
keep Russia contained in the north without too much effort, right?


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'm not teaming on France. Also I assumed russia was going to go for Norway so
I'm a bit confused with their plan as they haven't talked to me other than saying hello.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: StP(sc) can’t move to Nwy - it’s on the wrong coast as a fleet.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I mean when they were in Stp, and then they didn't try to go got Swe at all.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: StP doesn’t touch Sweden: the northern Russian fleet can never bother England in
the first few years of the game: its moves are almost always StP(sc) - GoB, then GoB-Swe.
The only time England ever has to worry about Russia in 1901 is if they send A Mos-StP,
because *that* unit *can* threaten Nwy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Maybe we’re misunderstanding each other?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah I think we are, I was talking about over multiple turns. It's just weird how
russia isn't making any moves for depots in the north and seems to be letting germany just
have at it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Russia didn't move because they lost track of time, it wasn't intentional, I'm
sure.  I haven't heard from them since the Spring moves.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Okay, I wasn't sure if had been some mind gaming or what happened.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: No, they totally screwed their position by not moving - look in the south!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah, that's why I wasnt sure if they were just playing really passive to try
some trick. But it's pretty obvious now looking at it.


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So it looks like while you worked something out with Russia, to carve Germany up,
you’re now reorienting against them.  You want to coordinate anything with me, or am I
“the enemy”? 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'm completely fine coordinating, what are you thinking?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well both of us have only two main competitors left: France and Russia. If we each
take on one while the other goes after the other, we’ll kinda split the board up but it’ll
be slow.  If we pick the same enemy, it’ll go faster, but we’ll have to leave ourselves a
little undefended in the opposite side.  I go after Russia, most likely France grows big
in the Med.  You go after France, Russia is breathing down your neck.  That’s my main
concern: how do I go after Russia if I know France will quickly be taking control of
Italy?  Can we somehow keep France tied down so we’re free to mostly focus on Russia?


1906, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Wow, did France actually stab you? In this position?!?  Doesn’t he know you can
throw your remaining strength into making sure he dies, to spite the stab?  Maybe she
thinks there is not enough time in the game for me and Russia to eliminate him?


1907, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Is France spinning you some tale about how they took Holland to build fleets to
hold me back?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: No, they haven't responded

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I've been backstabbred so I shall in turn backstabbr.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I can ask Russia if they will lay off off you for a couple of seasons so you can
throw your units against France.  I'm sure he'll attack you eventually, but I could
probably get you a two season head start?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah, I get the feeling I'm not going to survive much longer anyway. But it would
be nice to get back at france for their betrayal.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’m attacking France with all my strength. If you send Nth-Ech you’ll block Bre-
Ech, and if you also do Nwg-Nao and Edi-Nwg you can maybe take France down with you!


1907, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: please please please build an army at home to defend for a few more seasons?  I'm
attacking France and will help you exact your revenge on them, just don't give all your
centers to Russia? 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: If I can get into Spain, I will support you to hold in Portugal until the end of
1910 so that if we do it right, France gets eliminated for stabbing you, and you survive
with that center plus whatever you can hold in Britain (which I can't help either way
with)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: That was my plan, if I can take our france I'll die in peace

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’ll of course be glad to help enact the killing France part of that plan!


1908, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: so Russia is deciding to kill you to save his ass.  Can you bring Lon-Eng to help
me crush them both?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Wal-Lon to watch your back at the same time.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: That's was my thoughts.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: France will probably crush Portugal if I don't help now.  And you perhaps getting
to convoy Wal-Bre is my only chance at cracking Mar or Spa

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Howdy France, just wanted to reach out and see what your thoughts on the game
were.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hey England, I was wondering how you would want to align yourself, assuming it's
not against me, how far would you go to attack G or will you go with a northern opening
against R?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: I'm thinking of a defensive strategy to start just to see how things shake up,
I'm considering  an arctic expedition though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I see, well I was hoping to lure germany in a bit and then turn the table on them
with you


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I would to free up my fleet to MAO so that I can respond to Italian aggression but
your move to the channel has me worried. Do you plan to take norway?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah, I plan on taking Norway and wanted my fleet already in the water to move
wherever needed. I figured at some point we would negotiate who could go for bel or hol
while you get the rest of the iberian peninsula.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah, I was hoping to get a foothold in Bel. From there I could support e.g. your
new build into Hol.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: There seems to be some sort of central non aggression pact going based on their
movements.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Since G decided to stab me, I'm inclined to get back at them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I think we need to worry about germany getting alot of territory early.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah, Russia is going south, same for Austria. G has a free playing field. I don't
think we can stop 2 builds for G either

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'll probably reach out to russia and see if we can stop them from getting too
crazy in the north.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: afk for a bit

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I will also be on and off so might responses may be delayed today and tomorrow.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So what do you want to do with the channel? Mutual bounce?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: So that it looks like we're going for each other?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Let's see. We should plan out 1902 because after that G basically should have
completed their Atlantikwall and we can't get you in to help me any more

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I need to see what I does. I'm hoping I changes their mind about attacking Mar
because that's not so easy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
england: I agree, they're benefiting a lot from neither of us having moved into that spot.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If that goes well, I should have an army in Bel by fall 1902 or ready to support

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I've got my fleet going for eng.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Great. Let's see how things shake out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Did you reach some agreement with Russia?


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: No, they still haven't responded to me. I'm not sure why they moved the way they
did unless they're not trying to piss of Germany.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: How do you feel about next year moving your fleet into pic and I move mine into
the eng and one of us can support the other into Bel?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I could also go for Den and move my fleet into Nth to support you as well.


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think R just didn't submit orders

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm cool trying to support you into Bel. I'm thinking about how to move so that G
gets removed from Bur while also being able to support an attack on Bel

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think maybe moving my fleet to Mao so that I can take Portugal in fall and you
can take Eng to support an attack on Bel could be an option?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'm fine with that plan. I finally got russia to respond so hopefully we'll be
able to work together to stop Germany from the top and I can help you push them back as
well.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Maybe we can convince Austria to push from the other side to put pressure on all
sides?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Maybe but I'd think it unlikely

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah, might be to early for them to start backstabbring

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Since Italy tried for Tri, that's gonna be their focus. And R is no longer AFK so
hopefully that will help

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: As in, keep A busy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Instead of focusing on Bel, we could put pressure on Hol & Den if you move to Hel?
What do you think?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I was trying to convoy my army into den because I'm assuming germany is going to
try to move their fleet there. But I suppose we'll have two more turns to get them out if
I just go hel.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Russia is back, but they're still really bad about responding.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What would you achieve by convoying to Den?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: My army in edi to stop Germany from taking it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: btw, you can go A Nwy-Stp, see if R is paying attention haha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Just the threat of that may force R to defend and will allow A Nwy-Swe

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Then in Fall you have another support for attack on Den

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Might have to since they are responding at all.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: There's a good chance G is sweettalking them and offering Swe and an alliance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I suppose that's always a possibility

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
england: Germany responded back to a message I sent a while ago telling me I can have at
Russia if I let them keep swe. So I'm going to guess they're probably saying something
similar to russia.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
england: Are you okay with me moving my fleet into Eng?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
england: Russia is basically a vassal state of Germany as far as I can tell. Maybe you can
try to talk some sense into them? I'm going to plan on moving my fleet into Eng this
round, and see how I can support you from there.


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: No I didn't get any since you talking about germany sweet talking.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Reposting: Sure, I had expected you to move it to Eng in Spring tbh Now, without
Eng to support, it will be hard to take Bel if G makes the right moves.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I figured since you hadn't said anything you were not thrilled with the idea.  We
can always blame our diplomacy overseer for anything going poorly.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Have you tried talking to russia? I'm wondering if only you had issues sending me
messages or if it was a larger issue?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I have, but I don't think there were issues with the server. They were just busy
IRL

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If you didn't have the emoji show up on your messages or didn't click either 👍 or
👎 , just assume it didn't send


1902, Winter:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: The more I look at the board the more likely it seems T & R are biding their time
for R to rebuild and then ally up

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Not that it matters for us currently, we would still have to crush G asap to get
the cp we need to defend against that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So what's next? Will you support me into Bel?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah I think they're probably going to working together as well. Yeah I'll
support you in.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: After I push G out of Bur, I can push for Mun while you go for Kie or Den

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
england: Sounds like a solid plan to me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Sounds like a solid plan to me

france: Thanks for the assist by the way

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Turkey and Russia almost definitely teamed up

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Definitely working together. What's your plan this season? Hold or push further?
I'm possibly getting backstabbred by russia and making a push for Den.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think Den is good. G will probably disband fleets. You can also just go Nwy-Stp
on retreat if you're afraid of the stab there... I'll move the line up to munich for a
push next year. You can take Kie with my support or Den with your fleet, and I take Mun
after.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: There's a small chance you can just do A Hol-Kie, since G needs to cover Ber from
R

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Actually, if you could do that, that would guarantee I can move into the
Ruhrgebiet

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I can give it a shot

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Are you moving Bel? If not could you support, hol in case Germany tries a push
there?.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I was thinking of using bel to support a move into Ruh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Can you support A Bur-Ruh? Then I can support a hold in Hol.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

Hol I think I should be pretty good to hold off Russia from the north.

doing so.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: support a push into Hol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Okay. Also turkey reached out to me about attacking russia together, but they
wanted to know how I would stop you from taking over the Med. Are you fine with me going
for one of your suppy points to make it look like we're fighting?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: After Italy is finished I mean, we can coordinate it so that it just looks like
I'm going for it but you can defend it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Just something for the future.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Right, it's possible but there are no convincing moves available at the time so
really you could say that you're not in a good position for a stab

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah, I think they want something later on

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hey, it would've been much more helpful if you had used Kie to attack Ber. Now R
has an extra CP for free :/ Should've spotted that as well.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Imo, if you are doing a hold it needs to be with good reason

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: and Den couldn't have been pushed out anyway (you could've also tried moving to
Swe, just in case.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
england: I was expecting russia to make an attack to be honest.


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: You making a push on Mun this turn?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Because I get the feeling I'm about to get wrecked from the north and my best bet
is to push through middle with you and cut Russia in half.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yes, your support would be appreciated.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm moving in with Ruh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Done, got me just in time

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thanks!


1905, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: You have any thoughts on moving forward?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I figure trying to push russia out from the middle while I go from the top? I can
try to support you into Mun, but I will probably lose Kie.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think it's too late for Mun now

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Bah, adjucation at noon hmm


1906, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Holland is safe for now but R has some crazy navy built up

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

Between turkey, france:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Dear France, I have come up with a masterful strategy for world domination, and
while I can’t give you all of the details (for obvious reasons), suffice to say, it
involves killing you *last*!  So whatever I can do to keep you strong and healthy so there
is still a France to kill (or, heaven forbid, be killied by?!?), I’m at your service!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: (Knowing whether to mark that as “truth” or “a lie” was tricky, when it should
clearly be labeled “wishful thinking”, y’know?)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I must say, that was quite a mouthful to rate yeah.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah, I'm a bit of a chatty Cathy.  You'll either get used to it, or convince all
my neighbors to kill me to shut me up. ;P

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I hope you do well, I have a sweet spot for Turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well then we must both hope that Italy does *poorly*, in which case both of our
hopes for each other doing well will be increased. 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Not always... but usually.  It's probably been a while since I've been on a board
where F, I, and T all did well.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm not even sure that is possible. Maybe in an extremely concerted effort.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: But as it turns out, that would be fine with me in this case.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: In my neck of the woods, we call it "Care-bear" play. 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Speaking of Italy - they're the one I haven't heard from yet.  You?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Nothing yet.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Could be talking to A a lot or just afk for now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Nobody I've talked to has heard from them, so I'm guessing the latter.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: unless everyone is screwing with me already, which would be typical. 😛

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I considered it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah, it'd be much more fun for all of y'all to say, "Oh yeah, jeez, Italy just
blabbers on and on!  Oh, you haven't heard from them?  How strange..."

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It's fun but I want you to do well so no incentive for me to lie to you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Rockin'. Then lemme know when you *do* hear from them, and it'll let me know
whether that happened before, or *after* they talked to me. 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: (and I'll give you the same info, natch)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sure, would be nice for me to know if they are back


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Nice defense over there.  It’s a fun start for France when you see moves to Eng,
Bur, *and* Mar!  But even more fun when they are parried off 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: You have some... not fun guessing games for the fall though. I wish you luck in
that!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Did Russia stab you in Bla? What's your feeling for alliances?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Looks like Italy and A are friends maybe?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Russia told me they wouldn’t go.  I told them I wouldn’t go, but said I’d cover my
ass.  Looks like I told they truth and they didn’t, but it’s not irreparable, at present.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I/A are friendly-ish.  The Rom-Ven means Austria will be covering Tri in fall.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Clearly E/G/I coordinated spring

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I am ok with Austria.  I’ve actually done everything I said to everyone I’d do.
Fat lot of good that’ll do me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I believe what you're saying but I'm hoping they will see their initial alliances
are no longer in their best interest 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: it's hard to convince people though

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: If I go with A against R, it wouldn’t help you unfortunately: A shows no interest
in anti-Italian early moves (which is sensible, if not ideal for you)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That's fine, I just kinda need to know how eveyone aligns with G

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: because it looks like an amazing game for them from spring

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I’m trying to convince England that it would be super fun to coordinate the
“convoy-Den” + GoB-Bal move

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But I don’t get the impression they’re that creative

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: GoB? You mean let G get Swe while convoying into Den?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Maybe you should play hardball with Italy: “lay off me and if you’re my only
neighbor who didn’t attack me, and I go down, I’ll give you my dots to spite them.  Attack
me with them, and you’ll get Mar and nothing more ever, I’ll make sure of it!”

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yes that’s what I mean.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I love risky plays like that. Once got Sev in 1901, that was fun

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hah nice!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Tbf, Italy has a great position to attack Austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Oh I love the Pie-Trl + Ven-Tri + build A ven combo, it’s great if you can get
those all to work in fall

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Just need some help from Russia, get them to tell Austria they feel they really
*have to* go to Gal again, and they’re happy to bounce, but they simply can’t risk holding
in fall...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Does a bounce from War help that much?


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It’s irrelevant now, since Italy *did* attack Austria. Unfortunately for you: your
position would be much better had Italy attempted Mar! 😦


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah, I had considered it but I had to cover my bases

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yep understood


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Tricky situation... E/G finally fighting, and you lose Bur, but you really can't
function with just one fleet, right?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But luckily for you, Germany doesn't seem to understand this game is about
negotiation and alliances.  Do you think you can count on England to actually work with
you?


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm not sure but we share a common enemy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You know you could flip sides on the I/A axis and get half of the balkans probably
right?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Nor do I want my right flank to succumb to austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Succumb too Austria, succumb to me, six of one, half dozen of another, no?    But
yes, A/I war is as fantastic for me as E/G war is for you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I don't see what you're gaining from this long term by letting R build back up.
They seem intent to not anger G. So what then? Austria or you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Russia just took Sweden from Germany, with English help.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That was a lost cause

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I encouraged that alliance, helping break the E/G you and Russia were so keen to
have broken up.  Now England and Russia are both mildly anti-German.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sweden was only a lost cause for Germany if they fought with England.  If they'd
known how to be an alliance player, they'd have been offering to give centers to England
to cement their alliance.  They didn't do that, and got stabbed for it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I don't understand people who play this game like it was gunboat.  The game is
called diplomacy for a reason: make friends, use those friends to kill everyone off who
doesn't have friends, try and convince other people to stop being friends with your
enemies, and eventually kill your friends before they kill you.  Forget "the board"...
"the dots" - it's about *the people*

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: but yes, if I want to win, I have to stab a knife into someone.  Gotta break some
eggs to make an omelette and all that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: so from your perspective, you're worried about seeing Austria get too big, is that
what I'm hearing?  Or Russia?  What worries you, now that E/G is probably not a thing, for
the time being?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I see your assitance with Austria but I wouldn't want that to go too far because
Italy's current position is unstable

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah Italy is ready to get pretty wrecked, unless Austria  or I decide to stop
working together


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So you coming to prop Italy up, or get a piece for yourself?  We should talk,
either way!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Right, I'm moving into the Mediterranean to get a better position for either case


1905, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: why did you not support Kie and cut Munich?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Adjucation happened before I could think things through

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: bummer. I never really get a chance to turn on Russia and slow them down if they
keep growing so fast I never have an easy chance to stab... I'm doing my best to keep up
with them at this point!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm happy to cooperate since they will be +3  on your supply now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm not quite sure what they would do by now but stab you or defend against a stab
given that they have England in the bag

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: as long as you're not helping England, that's for sure!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That's true but I prefer to win

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Is that really likely on this board?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I don't know but I'd love for us to work together to make sure we both have a shot

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Tactically, on this board, England falls to Russia, and you can’t hold back my
fleets without two fleet builds (but then you can’t hold Burgundy on land). If Russia
stabs me before I stab them, they have a shot at 18 before 1910.  I could stab them but I
have much a smaller chance at 18 in time. There is no way you can get that big unless you
eat England alive from behind before they know what’s happening


1905, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I don't really play with the deadline in mind. Kind of ruins it for me :p

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: In any case, I'm not just gonna sit here and die a slow death.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sure, so pick  direction which has a possible  good outcome: there are two powers
on the board  capable of totally overrunning your position, so the only option is to
somehow play them against each other (by suggesting to one of the two that you’d
intentionally make the other one win the game, for example, and be willing to follow
through on it) or be willing to think outside the box and throw yourself fully at one
power or the other in a last ditch attempt to get as big as you can in the time left.
This is a game of alliances - being willing to sacrifice your position for a chance at
either winning or dying in the process is the only shot any of us have!


1906, Spring:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
turkey: would you have time to be able to stab England if you had a build from Italy, and
then we could get Russia to support you into Hol?  With two builds, you could perhaps
quickly get to England and kill them fast enough to hold Russia back until I stabbed them
in the east, and you worked to control the west?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I will try to talk to Russia and see how it goes. I just don't know if I can get a
piece of Italy without arousing suspicion. Tunesia?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Tunis is now undefended, and yes, if you were to promise you'd use the build you
got from that center to attack England, I'd be ok with you taking that - I'd focus on the
two remaining Italian home centers I've got almost surrounded, and would also promise to
stop hitting Marseille soo you could bring your Pie army back home to ensure Burgundy is
still more safe in case Russia won't help you and keeps attacking Ruh to get to Bur.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: But if Russia is willing to work with you, then yeah, you could get two builds,
and you'd be back in this game, as you'd be able to get to Lvp/Lon before Russia could.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: But if you don't feel comfortable with any of that, I'd understand.  You've gotta
do what you feel safest doing.  Don't even feel like you need to tell me - I'll do the
same either way: Italy has turtled-up pretty good, so it'll take most of my effort just
too crack Rom+Nap.  You can ignore Tun or take it - your choice.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good. I'll use the Tun build to shore up my defenses with a fleet from Bre.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Did you come to an arrangement with Russia which ended up feeling safe for you to
try?  This game could get to a 12-12-10 three way draw if you can get into position to get
Lvp and Lon with builds from Tun and Hol.  I *think* there enough seasons before fall 1910
to get there still...


1906, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: we still playing this game? 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah I thought about that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: We'll see what happens with Russia...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Yep.  I re-read my orders, and I'm crushing Rome and letting you have Tunis to
build for the last few game years


1907, Spring:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Ok, so where do you need to see my units to give you the breathing room to
eliminate England by the end of 1910, so we can have a 3-way draw, instead of 4-way?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If we can DMZ some area between italy and me then that would free up my fleets

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: You are in the more precarious position (although the game is time limited so the
danger isn’t quite so great).  So you make a specific proposal and I’ll tell you if that
is asking too much or is fine as long as you keep your end of the bargain.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: If you left it up to me, I could say: I’ll park my fleets on Italian coasts and
leave TyS empty, but keep Ion for defense

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: I normally make very specific proposals, so there's no ambiguity: if you are
keeping two fleets in the Med, to protect Tunis, then I can offer to park Tunis on the
coast, and do Nap-Tys, Rom-Tys (self bounce) and Ion-Tun (to cut your support so you can't
do Tun S Wes-Tys to force Tys from me).  But if you have a different specific suggestion,
I'm all ears.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So what happens with Tys?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: F Tys parks in Tus in this proposal, as that’s the only space available for it
that is not occupied

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I guess given your lack of response you don’t like any of my proposals or have any
alternative ideas, so I’ll assume you’re *not* going to focus on getting rid of England.
That’s totally reasonable and within your rights, but then that means I have no reason to
hold back, I guess.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I am not attacking you at the moment but I also don't like the proposal.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So do you have another one?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I can withdraw from Pie if you withdraw from Tys, but not to Tus.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm not sure how I can make sure you don't attack Tys if I pull back without doing
a self-bounce in Tys and Ion-Tun to make sure you don't support an attack on Tys?  If I
pull back, and you do Tun S Wes-Tys, you'll get in.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: If Tus makes you uncomfortable, you could *stay* in Pie, as protection?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That isn't much of protection since it would be easy to get through.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Tbf, in the long term you could push through anyway. But all I want is some
buffer.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah, I get it.  I guess we could lock down on position a bit: Tys S Ion-Tun, Ion-
Tun, Wes S Tun, Tun H, and that way I am not in Tus, and Tunis is locked down safely as
well?  I wouldn't be pulling out if Tys in that case.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think that's fair. Let's go with that

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sounds good.  I'll go set my orders before we run out of time.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah, time limits.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Sorry about lying about Tus/Lyo, I just had nothing left to do with those.
Couldn't just leave my units waiting around doing nothing.


1907, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So you do realize that both Bel and Hol can get taken this fall, right?  Russia
can snap up English centers at their leisure, as England isn't bothering to defend
anyways.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And while you have no reason to trust me, Hol->Bel would mean you only lose one of
those two, and since Russia has to do Mun-Ruh too cut Ruh S Hol, so if you counter-
attacked: Bur s Ruh-Mun, you could possibly take Munich.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Seems like you do care about maintaining at least the status quo

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: between you and russia that is.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I can see another way in which I can not got steamrolled. You need to step up and
put some pressure on Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I do realize that yes, Russia growing too big too fast is super dangerous for me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Since you have no reason to trust me, watch what I do.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And please cover your ass 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Show me some fireworks 🧨

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: 🎆  big enough for you? 🎆

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: (and did I not tell you about Hol+Bel?)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: (you're welcome ;P )

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You did, but I wasn't willing to make the first stab 🙂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: oh that's why I said "watch I do" - I figured you had to see it to believe it.


1908, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So, from here, what do you plan to do with Lyo?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
turkey: So to be honest, Tunis isn’t something you can safely hold, with England still
alive and Russia on your doorstep.  So unless you have a better offer, I’ll be using Lyo
to force access to Tunis, since I basically loaned it to you in the first place to get
builds to attack England.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I see, well it's true that England is about to fall

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: At least this way you can focus on that direction instead of where it’s a losing
battle.


1908, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: well that was nice of Russia to give you Munich!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

Munich!

you or Germany. Thoughts?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
italy: Works for me! Are you looking to expand into the Balkans first? Would you be
interested in Italy-Austria alliance to take on Turkey there?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
italy: Hey Turkey, Austria floated the idea of joint expansion into the Balkans. I'm not
super interested in heading that way so not planning on supporting them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Hmm ok they also told me that they wanted to keep you out of Greece so they lied
to either you or I or I guess something has changed their mind.


1901, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Looks like Russia is firmly committed South but Germany is gifting them Sweden
plus England looks like they wont put up any resistance either. A runaway Russia looks
likely. Do you plan to try for Greece?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Only if you'd be willing to support - I'd hold it as the edge of my western
expansion, but have no interest in going further. Do you know where Austria plans to go?
Turkey-Italy alliance could push Austria north to face Germany and Russia.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah fair enough. I can't be sure of what Austria plans to do now as they seem to
be spreading misinformation pretty liberally according to Russia. I will let you know if
I'm in a position to support you into Greece. May need to try and keep Russia out of Rum.
Would be more than happy to work together - I have no faith in what either Russia or
Austria are telling me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting

Venice

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

definitely watch out for that

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
italy: Interesting, Turkey and I are going to team up against Austria.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Cool. I do worry about Turkey getting so large. He seems to be very manipulative.

army?

Sevastopol this turn

1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: We should definitely talk since Turkey just built a second fleet

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It would be a good idea I think to take the Adriatic and the Ionian, and I can be
a third fleet to help you keep the Ionian.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm extremely worried about an Austria-Turkey alliance dominating the board, and a
Turkey solo resulting from it. Adriatic will keep Venice safe for a very long time and
also serve as a way to defend the Ionian. My fleet can also help with the defense if you
so request.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Agree - Trying to figure out how deep Austria's alliance runs. Think Turkey will
have to swallow it sooner than later, so hoping to turn them to help contain

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Sounds good. I can tell you that the alliance is rock solid right now, and they
probably will stay allies the whole game unless they get stuck


1903, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: It looks like Austria was already trying to get into position to attack you since
you bounced with them in the Adriatic Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Hmm. I wonder if it makes sense to support Ionian to hold this time since Turkey
is in the Eastern Mediterranean. Austria might be worried about Venice-Trieste and not go
to the Adriatic again

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: If you think that Turkey will stab Austria you could also ask him to support your
convoy into Greeve

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: This is just a suggestion. But something to consider: Ionian Sea C Tunis-Albania
Tunis-Albania Venice-Trieste Tyrhenian Sea S Ionian Sea H

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
italy: Turkey can just take Gre on its own

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Damn. You would have been in such a strong position if you used the suggestion I
gave you!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: You would have taken Trieste for a build, you would have kept control of the
Ionian Sea, andd you would have an army in Albania to take Serbia or Greece.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I'm on your side- I'm trying g to help you. Iyou are prudent to distrust me, but
it's us Vs Turkey and Austria right now. I'm trying to prevent a Turkish solo!

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: If I were you, I would retreat to Apulia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: This is the only way to prevent Austria from taking the Adriatic for free. It also
lets me help you with my fleet if you move Tyrhenian to Naples and my fleet moves to the
Tyrhenian

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Anyway, we're still in a great place due to some lucky guesses by Russia and
Germany NMRing, so I'm going to help you as much as I can. Just ask.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Would you be ok with me building an army in Marseilles? This would give me the
option of moving to Piedmont with the goal of taking Tyrolia and helping you attack
Austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: That could be the case if you don't mark the message with the thumbs up or thumbs
down.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I highly recommend that you move to Apulia to prevent Turkey from convoying a unit
into that territory.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
italy: Truly the hindsight is 20/20

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Yeah, that's one of the frustrating things about Diplomacy haha. Glad you are
here- I'm moving to the Tyrhenian and to Piedmont right now to help out.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

Sea? Any ideas for me?

1904, Winter:

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: Sorry for changing the plan- I desperately needed the builds to have even a small
chance of attacking England- just wanted to say that I have absolutely nothing else to
gain from attacking you

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: Your only threat at this point is Turkey, so If you keep Naples and the Ionian you
will never lose Tunis or Naples and have a strong chance to pick up Greece

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: If you keep the armies I think Turkey would get Tunis and Naples, and you would be
eliminated and therefore not get paid the survivor prize pool money.

attack Russia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Ohhhh haha no I'm not looking to move on you. I moved all my troops that opposite
way. I think it's genuinely good for you (especially with Italy starting a Lepanto) and if
Russia is busy it frees me up in the west. You see what I'm saying?

Prussia would benefit us both. Let me know what you think. Also, there are plenty of joint
risks to us both, particularly as the game progresses. Let me know if you've got any
interest working together

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hm I'm getting your messages only in email form. Not to worry. Yes, I did say
Prussia in my original message. I think the Baltic sea sounds fair enough as well. Why
don't we work together toward those ends? I'm not shocked at the idea Britain might be
looking to come for me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: Hi germany! Are you up for Sil as a DMZ? It would be in both of our best interests
if we didn't get in a fight early on, as both of our great powers already have a lot to
deal with on our sides of the map. Looking forwards to a great game!  -Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

even a potential alliance against England?

something out, I would love to be able to work with him.

peace as long as possible and a few allies I can trust is important as hell in this game

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

it's anything catastrophic

common interests, if you're open to it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I am inclined to agree. How would you like to approach Scandinavia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: I'd like denmark, norways all yours. Perhaps we could move on Russia but I think
we should start with france, otherwise he'll become a problem for us both. After that we

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

three to counter Russia and Italy?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing

do you think? And wdu mean what's his deal?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: How do you want to open up? There are a lot of options and opportunities?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: But he may just have figured we want to move west and tried to throw me off

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
england: I think I'm going to go EC to be aggressive on France, and take Norway

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: He also said he's working closely w france

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Let's be aggressive with france so we can switch back to Russia asap

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hm yeah Russia also told me there were murmurs you wanted to attack me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: My only dialogue with Russia has been to advocate for the equal sharing of
Scandinavia. I've been told that Russia seems to want to commit south.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I suspect that France and Russia are both worried about two players moving on
them early, and may be in an alliance to stretch us out.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: If Russia DOES want to commit south, it is logical that they'd try to prevent a
united northern threat. Considering that Rus/Fr may be coordinating, I am going to play
cautiously  and refrain from committing east or west

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Russia admitted to me that he's in an alliance with france

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: He intends to move on you it seems, so I don't think he's truly committing south.
Maybe just maintaining a hold. Either way time will tell

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: You told me you were looking to move aggressively against France. If we can get
Russia distracted by turkey especially with Austrian help ik the south their alliance
won't matter

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I was gonna play aggressive but i'm going to slow down to protect my expansion. I
don't want to deprive myself of builds because I spread myself too thin

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'm gonna to move to secure Norway, and maybe place myself to support you in
Benelux or move against France next turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

so I don't end up acting alone. Seems like Russia is focused on the south which is
excellent news for a move on France if we could just get Austria involved. He's playing
awfully passive

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: What happened with the Liverpool to London misorder last turn?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Regarding France, are you trying to take Belgium? I would prefer to have it
because otherwise you can get 3 builds and myself only 1

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: it works on the website I normally play

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'm not sure. I was under the impression I could move an army into a space that
was becoming vacant

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: oh I realize now that I'm a fool and it doesnt border. I wasnt paying attention
putting down the move

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Lol yeah they don't border 😂

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: And I hate to be so greedy to open up but I'm nervous that if I forego a build it
opens me up to have Russia, France or both collapse on me and then we're really fucked.
Particularly if France walks into Munich, I'll need both builds badly

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm more than willing to cede territory to you going forward when I'm better in a
position to subdue France or Russia depending on what we've decided. Does that sound
alright?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: It's really funny that you mention France and Munich.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: It just so happens that I've been talking to France, and they're under the
impression that I'll bounce you out of Denmark if they march into Munich.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Ah so he is moving into Munich? While I'd rather have that scenario not happen

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

would feel better with a fleet that could serve as a sort of home fleet, and I figured
London served as a better base for attacks

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright can we renegotiate? I'm not sure what France said to sway you. Was it the
three initial builds? Cuz you can have Belgium. I'd just really prefer to knock out
France. Belgium brest and Portugal can be yours. All I want is Paris and Italy can take
Marseilles and Spain. Really we can really negotiate however I'd just rather not be at
odds w you. Now I'd figure you'd much rather ally w me seeing as France has struck a deal
w every nation I've talked to so far which makes him not that trustworthy and he has three
fleets that can easily slip in your back door to my one that you have pinned on land... So
if you head my way he's gonna walk in your back door. I would bet you money. What do you
say? Can we strike some sort of deal?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Le me know your thoughts

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'm sorry mate. France's fleets are too big for me to piss him off. I won't push
past Denmark, and if you can negotiate peace with him I'll respect it

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright. Understood

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I mean honestly mate he's gonna attack you either way. And the two of us can stop
him... I'm not sure why you'd back off like that. I don't mean to be rude but how much
experience do you have with this game?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm saying honestly both cuz it's by far the most logical thing to do and he's in
great position to do it now that he's advanced and you've completely backed off and cuz
it's literally what he told me he was going to do

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: What makes you say we can push him back if he has deals with everyone?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
england: If you surrender Denmark to me, I will help you survive France's push. I am not
going to involve myself in this war for either side without immediately tangible benefits.
France is a difficult invasion for me, and I've spent a lot of time in the North Sea with
no new land.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: He doesn't have actual deals. Not ones people are intending to follow through on
cuz they don't trust him cuz he makes deals w everyone. Russia doesn't trust him and is
way too busy w Austria and turkey. Italy doesn't trust him either and I convinced him to
invade the south although he's kind of a mess at the moment. I actually don't know if
turkey or Austria has any sort of deal with france. And who is actually free to intervene
against us?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm not sure how you can make tangible benefits if you don't involve yourself
though honestly. And if you help me out we'll topple France and how can I come attack you?
Honestly. France is headed for you as we speak and is trying to sue for peace with me so
that he can complete his invasion of you. Not to mention he has three fleets you just
turned your back on. Please, listen to reason here. Either way, I'd much rather you take
Belgium. Can we make that deal?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
england: Sorry about the delay. I'm willing to exchange Belgium for cooperation against
France.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright sounds good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: How should I move? I don't know how to handle his fleets

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
germany: Well moving out of the channel seriously set you back

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
germany: But we can fix this

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: If you move to the north Atlantic, English Channel and North sea and your army to
Wales you can cover your back side and set up a convoy route into France

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: How's that sound

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I am not gonna go Nor Atl bcause I want a fleet in Nor, but the rest sounds good.
France wants to move into Picardy this turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Also given how weird the western triangle has been, can I ask what you're going
to do with your fleet? turning to face france leaves me vulnerable in that regard

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Oh I honestly don't know yet

naval dominance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: We might have some space between us now, but it won't be long until we're on each
other's door steps. You want to hash out a long term plan for cooperation?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hello and thanks for your message! I am certainly interested in your ideas on
this. Have you heard from Italy or Austria at all yet?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Not yet. Have you?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Nothing yet either.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright keep me updated

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: I think Russia is committing south. Do you plan to bounce him out of Sweden?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: What makes you say that? And no not likely

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well he has told me he wants to attack Austria. And Austria has told me that he
told them that he wanted to attack me. If either of those are true then a 3 unit south
start seems likely.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Hm understood. I think either way it might be in your best interests to jump on
Russia. I can't right away but I can come help you later in the game

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Yeah, I guess you have France to worry about? Otherwise Warsaw would be a pretty
easy option for you.

great situation to collaborate

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: I'm hoping we can come to a few agreements. Burgundy is a trouble spot for us
both. Could we dmz it? I think at the worst, non agression would be in both our best
interests, but I'd definitely be open to any proposition you've got

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sorry for the brief message- I'll be available for more negotiation later today. I
currently want to support Paris to Burgundy since I am not sure what everyone's plans are
yet, and if it looks like we are in good position to work together in the fall I can use
Burgundy to take Belgium.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: No worries. Alright. I understand the move to burgundy but I think it should be
obvious that any move into my territory would be met with aggression. Update me in the
fall of your intentions?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Thanks. Yeah, it's not that I don't trust you to DMZ Burgundy, but I can't think
of a reason not to make the move honestly since it completely protects me against both you
and Italy and still leaves room for us to work together. In that sense it leaves me some
flexibility to decide my intentions in the fall- the truth is that I currently have no
intentions and will let my targets pick themselves.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What are your plans in terms of your moves?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
germany: It looks like we've already got ourselves a rat. I've heard rumors of Britain
looking to attack me. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm sure he's roped you in too. While,
on the flipside he keeps trying to convince me to attack you alongside him. I think he
wants to pit us against each other and use the opportunity to swoop against either or both
of us. I think we should knock him out while we have the opportunity

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Yeah, I think you could be right about this. What would this look like? Do you
think England will end up taking the Channel?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Has he contacted you? And I'm not sure. I don't think he'd be that aggressive
right from the start. I can't say I know for sure. What do you want to do?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: England did contact me. I might be inclined to take the channel if Russia went to
St Petersburg with an army, but at the moment I think it is better to wait and see

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: (wait and see in terms of how to attack England)


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Nice opening moves. Are you going for Belgium? I was planning to head there from
Burgundy but it looks like you are in a position to support yourself in anyway.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah. Like I said seems England wouldn't be so thoroughly aggressive for a first
move. But we should keep an eye out you're right

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Thank you. Yeah I'd like to take Belgium. I hope there's no issue with that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I am concerned over you getting 3 builds and would be a lot more comfortable with
that arrangement if you build 2 fleets

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: To be honest I haven't thought about builds. I'll build completely contingent on
how everyone around me is postured. If you're not in position and russias not in a
position to attack me considering two fleets is a lot more viable


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Now why would you do that my friend? Bad mistake

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: I know it is an aggressive move, and I wanted to tell you about it but I couldn't
risk not getting the additional build to put down 2 fleets and attack England

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: I will be withdrawing from Munich immediately if you are willing to help with the
assualt- I know what this looks like but I promise you will absolutely love my builds

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: One more point. England proposed a plan to bounce you out of Denmark (but I knew
he was lying about it)

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
germany: See you could've gotten those two fleet builds with Portugal and Spain. You don't
need the army in Paris unless you want to attack me. If you don't build your army in Paris
and only build the fleets, we'll be fine. If you build the army in Paris it's going to
mean war

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I can do that for sure, though it does mean slowing down potential convoys into
England. What does this look like more broadly? Would you be willing to build a fleet in
Kiel to take the North Sea? Does this mean you are letting me keep Munich so I can build a
fourth fleet next turn?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Also, we can get creative with my unit in Munich by sending it to Tyrolia to
attack and/or help Austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: I want to make this work to the point of potentially waiving a build, so I hope we
can figure this out. Completely realistically speaking, I think EG struggles to take out
F, and EF or FG has a much easier time just considering the distribution of builds. That's
really important in a game that ends in 1910

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Another consideration is that England seems like the type of person to switch
sides at a moment's notice, and there are some concerns regarding whether they can write
orders without a misorder (given their turn 1 misorder)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: I think that The best way to do that is for you to build F Kiel and A Berlin,
which I realize is a tough sell, but if we do that we can have 5 fleets on England's 3 and
quickly roll over him

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: No response?


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I couldn't waive a build without hearing anything back from you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: It was written and I then changed my orders

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: Yeah sorry thought I responded

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I can't really do a fleet build

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: You understand

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
germany: I think we could work together but I definitely need you out of Munich and back
to burgundy and then out of burgundy from there

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: So let's work something out. What's the game plan?


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Why do you seem so determined to go after me? I have you at a stalemate that only
England can break meaning he'll reap the rewards and Italy and England are both poorly
defended. I honestly just want to know the strategic motivation behind it. Legitimate
question. I'm curious what you see that I don't...

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: I'll send Brest to English Channel and MAO to Irish Sea, but I need Belgium so
that I don't go down a build.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: In regards to your question, wouldn't you agree that it is not me, but you who are
committed towards attacking me? You built two armies and tried to take Picardy. Not saying
we can't recover from that- but you left yourself no option to attack or defend against
England. Whereas my 2 fleet builds can be used against England and are in position to do
so.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Cuz you did what I thought you were gonna do. I don't want you taking Belgium and
I need you out of ruhr which is one of the places I thought you'd go and is kinda an
aggressive move. Now I'm not super interested in giving up Belgium to be honest but I'm
not an unreasonable man. Let's negotiate.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: At the end of the day I need a dot, whether that's Munich or Belgium or something
else. In return I'd push fleets into Irish, English, and MAO, which sets up a convoy into
Wales. And I might try to persuade Russia to help you keep Denmark.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: On your end you should probably take the Helgoland Blight while you still can.
That will make it especially hard for England to keep attacking you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: If the English fleet gets into Denmark and you aren't in the Helgoland, it becomes
super easy for England to support themselves into hel and then convoy to
Kiel,Holland,Belgium, etc.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: But if you are in the Helgoland all of a sudden they have to support Denmark to
hol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: "hold

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Alright I'll think about the move set and get back to you in the morning

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: I don't see why you need a dot

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Just disband the troop in ruhr. That would have us certainly on peaceful terms

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Because you're asking me to use 3 fleets, 1 army (for a convoy), and lose a unit
to attack England. When you've been super aggressive towards me with your builds and
moves. I'm not going to attack England if you aren't willing to make any consessions.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: OK I understand what you're saying. I'll think of something amicable for us both
when I wake up fr

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Did you think of anything? Just curious.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
germany: Oh sorry. I've been real busy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: Hold on

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I mean. One thought is to have me take Belgium this year and for me to give it to
you back next year. That way you can build a fleet and I would be out of Ruhr as well
(Ruhr to Belgium). And I'd use Belgium to convoy out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You still there?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: Sorry

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: Yes

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: No need to apologise. I get that you are busy for labor day weekend. Just know
that I need a real response before the deadline is over if you are serious about actually
working things out. I'll be around for the entire rest of the day.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: I think that should be agreeable. Let me look at the map again

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Seems like you've lost interest in this game? I'd be upset if you weren't talking
to me. But the truth is you aren't talking to anyone.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If you've lost interest in the game you'll still get paid as long as you put in
orders or until you get eliminated. I'd be happy to help you with either of those 🤣🤣🤣

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

rapes us


1903, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: Yeah I agree

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Sorry I haven't lost interest in the game it's just not on conspiracy so I don't
think to periodically check this all

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: And the moves that got entered were from days ago

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: So let's work something out. I'd love for us to stop all the infighting and make
an efg happen

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
germany: That's what I wanted from the getgo

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Juggernauts coming though and regardless of if you are got buffer or not if you
let that buffer go down in me and England it'll steam roll you just the same

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: I'm thinking you want to move to Tyrolia and support Ruhr to Munich while I swing
my fleets back south


1903, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Ouch, England got you good.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: I can help you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You still around? If you don't make a very specific move you will lose 4 supply
centers this year. No matter what, you will be losing at least 2 supply centers. It's up
to you how much you actually want to stay in the game.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: How would like to work together though?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Hold on and I'll respond more in full

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
germany: Yeah I'm still here

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: Well, I'm not actually sure what the orders are going to end up being, but what I
can tell you are my current moves so that it can help you plan your defense. I'm moving to
Ruhr and supporting myself to Belgium (no use in lying about that). So Ruhr's support,
whatever it is, will be cut.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I think it is safe to assume that Munich and Holland supports will also be cut

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: So my recommendation to you if you want to stay in the game would be to use Berlin
to support Ruhr to Kiel.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: I tell you this with little risk since if you tell England, he'll simply change
the plan to one without this key vulnerability

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: Now, you have reason to mistrust me, but the truth is that I have 3 fleets and
only 2 armies. I stand to gain the least from continuing to attack you. And my largest
concern is a Turkey/Russia or Austria/Turkey alliance, which is where I plan to put my
focus. I intend to let England and Russia squabble over your supply centers while I move
fleets south to help out Italy

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: And with Russia taking Munich, your survival means that we could coordinate to
take it back in the case of a Russia/Turkey alliance.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: So it looks like you really have given up

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I know things are looking bleak, but if you are willing to entertain me for a bit
I have a plan that might keep you alive, and thus get a slice of the $24 pool for
survivors.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Just to make sure you see it- the plan would involve you retreating to Tyrolia and
capturing an Austrian supply center

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Whatever the case, I highly encourage you to stick it out because that way you'll
get paid

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: So.... ?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Hello, Russia! I hope we can both agree that peace between our nation's would be
beneficial for the both of us?  I'd like to suggest that in return for letting me into
Romania, you will have my support should you wish to expand into Scandinavia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: Hi Austria! I can definitely agree that peace between our nations would be good
for both of us! Unfortunetly I can't agree to letting you have Rumania, as that is
basically the back door into Russia. If you do try to take it, then there is going to have
to be war between our two great countries. Also I don't see how you could really support
me into Scandinavia... But that besides, I think we would both benifit from an alliance
against Turkey. What do you think about that?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
austria: In that case, I will keep out of Romania if you do the same, we'll keep it as a
DMZ?  I'll admit my promise to help you with Scandinavia was a little optimistic, but do
excuse me as I'll blame it on a tad too much Austrian beer.  We should keep an eye on
Turkey, but I feel as though an alliance this early on will not leave us in the best of
standing with the rest of Europe.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: If were going to have an alliance, we should aim for blitzing turkey. It's the
power triangle; Austria/Turkey/Russia. Only one of them is going to survive very long.
Also, what is your relationship with Italy looking like? Just a note: I am willing to work
out an agreement of who gets what part of the balkans, but I am taking Romania. It is
essentially part of Russia and leaving it as a DMZ just will not do if Turkey goes for the
Black Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I will give you Romania as long as we can take out Turkey asap  Should we start
this turn?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ofc we should start this turn.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I'll push down to Serbia and continue to push from the south

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I have not yet spoken in any great detail with Italy and am waiting to hear back
from them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

despite your betrayal, I still think we could have a very powerful alliance that would be
able to crush turkey within a year or two. If we got Italy  involved, I'm sure we could
figure something out where, for example you support me into Rum, and Italy supports you
into Bul.


1904, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: Hi austria. Turkey told me you're alliance is over. Is that true?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting

will be elliminated. I say we work together to make that someone be turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: What do you think?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
russia: They told me they are interested in working with me against you and are going to
try to take Ser. So what I think we should do is you attack Rum with Bud and Gal, which
would cut support and let me take Sev. That way we get two of Turkeys territories, which
would be a big blow to them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Do you have any proof to these claims?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: At the same time however, it does seem plausible that Turkey will move on Serbia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

turkey)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I figure there's not much we can do to stop him from pushing in the north unless
you're able to stop him from getting those SCs yourself. I'm pretty tied up in the South
and reckon I'll be out soon enough. We just need to try and stop him slowly eating his way
up to 18

getting 3 more centers, and then we will all win in a 3, 4, or 5 way draw when the game is
hard-capped at 1910

Between austria, turkey:

1901, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hey Austria! How's it going? I am hoping we can work together on this one. No
point getting into any early conflict which will only serve to help everyone else. How do
you like to split up the Balkans?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Hi Turkey! I fully agree that we should stay peaceful with eachother. How do you
like the sound of you getting Greece and Bulgaria and I'll go for Romania and Serbia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: That sounds good. If we stick together we can get through this early game intact.
What's your read on Russia and Italy? Have you heard from them?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Haven't heard from either of them yet unfortunately

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ah well our biggest issue is keeping Russia out of Rumania. I will see if they
have plans to move most units south. It sounds like they might be.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
austria: Russia is planning to take you out as soon as possible, and is asking me to help.
How do you feel about moving against Russia, as I believe that he will be the biggest
threat to the two of us. He is really posturing in his communications with me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sure, that makes sense. Like I said, first thing would be  to keep Russia out of
RUM, whether that be by supporting yours or my army in.  Italy is pretty quiet but what I
did hear from him was fairly anti Austrian by the way. I believe they are probably pretty
tight with Russia, them being natural allies anyway.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well I'm getting the same sort of stuff from Russia that you have. They are
indicating to me that they will commit south and want to attack you directly with my help.
I have told them I'd consider it but know that I am firmly locked in to working together
with you. Looks like our neighbours have made the decision for us really which makes it
easy right?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
austria: I'm quite happy to support you going into Romania as I can imagine that I'll need
my forces to fend off Italy. Will you be moving up to Bulgaria this turn and go onto
Romania from there?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok yes let's do that and I can support you into Greece the following year if you
don't get it this year.


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Just confirming that you will support my BUL army into Rum this season? Looks like
Russia is firmly committed South but Germany is gifting them Sweden and England looks like
they wont put up any resistance either so we better not let them take RUM as well or
they'll be running rampant in no time.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I can confirm that I will definitely be supporting you into Romania.  Russia has
been trying to sow doubt between us by telling me that you told him that I plan to attack
him


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Nicely done! I reckon we've got Russia on the backfoot now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yes, nice one. I'm glad we could sort things out. Next is to get you into Greece
then we'll have secured our front and can go from there. Russia does have three on RUM but
we can fend that off together and Warsaw for you and Moscow for me can be the mid-term
goal. What do you think?


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Sounds like a plan. I'll support Rum this turn and move down into Greece

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Ah, I didn't see that Italy was in Greece. Would have been wise to check the map
before sending messages

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Haha yeah well we can knock him out of there if you like, either in the spring or
fall, he can't stop it since he built that fleet in rom...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: What do you want me to do in regards to Russia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: We can support your bud army into gal. I think that would be best. So I support
you into gal and support ser army into Greece. If it works out for spring I mught be able
to get a convoy in in fall but that's probably a next year thing.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Yeah okay, that works

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hmm we might need to change our plans. I think Russia is planning to go to sil
anyway. Still on for Greece though. What are you going to do about tri? Can you trust
Italy not to go for it?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah i think best to support you into Greece in the fall. Just need to hold in rum
this season. If you can still support me in rum that would be appreciated.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Roger that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I'm not sure if going for Greece this turn is entirely preferable as Italy said
they plan to move out and it might be better not to provoke them quite yet

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok good call


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well looks like Italy messed it up. Anyway thanks for the support. Looks like I
did need it after all. What do you want to do this season?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Now Italy has moved into Tyr, which we agreed was a DMZ so if you could support
Ser in Greece that'd be much appreciated. What do you want to do Vis a vis Russia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: No problem, I will support you into Greece. If you can attack gal to cut the
support there and support me in rum that would be great. All going well we get one each.
Do you think Italy will be getting out of Greece though anyway?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Actually don't worry about supporting in rum, just the hit on gal should do it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Just confirming that you still need my support into Greece? And can still hit gal
for me?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
austria: Yes for both

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Italy claims to be moving out of Greece. I might need to pull the support. I'm
being told that you and Russia might be attacking me instead 😟

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Meh I'll trust you over them. Ill keep the support locked in. If you and Russia
wanted to take rum you could do it. Then we would be bogged down for the foreseeable
future and that would just help the West. We have the jump on the west at this point so
I'll hope you're still on board for that reason.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Russia and I haven't been in contact since I first betrayed him. May I ask who
told you this?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
turkey: Italy was suggesting it more than saying it but they got me a bit paranoid anyway

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Now there's something. Italy was suggesting that he and I go against you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah I'm not surprised. He was also offering me support into Serbia. We can stick
to our guns here and easily take Russia and Italy. Ive got the paranoia in check now.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Aye, Russia was also asking me to turn on you but we've got a good thing going
here


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Russia has asked me to work with him and Italy (don't know for sure that they are
in cahoots yet), and suggested that he support me into Romania and Italy into Bulgaria.
This is of course, not possible now that Italy had retreated from Greece.  I was wondering
perhaps if I should string Russia along, so that we may know his moves?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: You could definitely do that if you like. We will know more once we see where
Russia builds

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I suspect Italy and Russia would be working together at least at some level. They
are obvious allies. We have the jump on both of them now though


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So I was thinking I would push into UKR this year and then MOS. Depending on how
things go, I can support you into WAR and go for MOS next year. IF you can support my RUM
army to UKR and Russia covers WAR then the UKR army will have to disband. Also you can
perhaps take the ADR? If you get it, we can get ION in the fall. What do you think?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Done and done. Supporting RUM - UKR, Disrupting BOH and hopefully taking ADR


1903, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: What do you want to do for this one? We should probably repeat our fleet moves.
This time we would get one or the other

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: If you can disrupt UKR, I'll stop BOH and see if Germany could hit SIL and then
I'll move GAL into WAR, which will deprive Russia of a build

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ok have locked that in

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Might need to shift tack a little bit. Would love to break through into Russia but
maybe we need to make ground into Italy first?


1903, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Aye, we seem to be in a bit of a stalemate at the moment

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Ill come in to the ADR so don't go there with your fleet. Also I will support your
army in GAL to UKR - that might get us somewhere. But I guess we will have a new army in
WAR to worry about. Will check again after the builds.


1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: It wont be worth it. You just get to be the second target for Russia and Italy. If
you want to turn it around, let me know

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Although since Germany has given gifts to everyone and England has essentially
stopped playing this game has deteriorated into pointless territory


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: It has gotten rather back and forth


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well you've given up your best ally for... well... nothing? Are you going to
follow through as Russia's Puppet?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Honestly, at this point I don't even know. Fancied a little shake up as the game
was getting a bit stale

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yeah I get that. If you can convince Russia to worry about the main threat -
France. Call a truce and you and I can both try and hold France back. If not, I will
obviously just help France take it out for the price of my survival. I don't really mind
either way

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Will see what Russia has to say

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Russia should be moving to Boh and Sil, you and I should get into ION and TYS,
knock Italy out because why not. However, if Russia doesn't move his armies west to Boh
and SIL or he moves MOS to UKR, it will be pretty obvious that he's just going to take you
out.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I do reckon he'll try to come after me after I betrayed him at the start

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing

move to Piedmont, which could be an indication that you want to play defensively.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I have not yet heard anything from Italy unfortunately.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What are your thoughts in terms of your moves?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: You've done well getting 3 builds this season! May I ask if you have made any
alliances?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I have no chance of keeping Munich and England is in the channel, so it's honestly
a less than ideal situation.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I was planning to work with Germany, but it seems like they plan to attack me now
that I took Munich.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Ah yes, that it's unfortunate

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So. What exactly is going on in your region? It looked like you and Turkey were
buddies but those Turkish builds aren't that ideal for you I think.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I am very worried about a steamroller/Russia Turkey alliance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I must admit that I am worried that Russia and Turkey are in cahoots, and Russia
let us take Romania so that I'd trust Turkey for them to then turn on me and push West

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think it's the most likely explanation for A Warsaw. If Russia was worried about
Turkey, wouldn't they build A Moscow? Likewise, if Turkey intended to take Sevastopol.
Wouldn't A Smyrna make more sense to capture Armenia and then Sev?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think it's the most likely explanation for A Warsaw. If Russia was worried about
Turkey, wouldn't they build A Moscow? Likewise, if Turkey intended to take Sevastopol.
Wouldn't A Smyrna make more sense to capture Armenia and then Sev?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: By the way. I was wondering for the longest time about you and Italy's moves. I
won't tell anyone. But is the plan to convoy Venice to Tunis?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That's freaking awesome if so

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Not sure if it is the best plan if Russia and Turkey are working together. The
army could be needed more in Albania

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: By the way. Any suggestions for me in the north? I've been hearing different
things from Germany and England so I'm at a bit of a crossroads in terms of who to trust
and what to do.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Well, I found an ally since I think Russia will move to Silesia to pull some
German units away from Munich

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I haven't heard from England or Germany on why they plan to do unfortunately

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: No worries. Hopefully you have things figured out with your neighbors. I think
Turkey is sowing a lot of discord between Russia, you, and Italy to his own advantage

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Aye, he is most likely up to something


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You need a build this turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Whatever you do, don't let Turkey take Greece AND Sevastopol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any updates on your plans regarding Turkey?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I will tell you this. In the first year, Russia told me he was working with you
against Turkey. Somehow, when the orders were read, Turkey had convinced both you and
Russia to work with him.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So it seems like Turkey has been playing both sides from the start.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm not trying to be super nosy, and I apologize in advance if I am coming off
that way, but for my long term interests it is pretty important that Turkey doesn't start
explosively growing and wiping out half of the map. Any chance you and Russia can figure
things out to recapture Rumania from Turkey?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
austria: Russia won't work with me on this unfortunately

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: That's too bad. Is it like he is not responding to you, or he flat out refused?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Because it is possible that he has been MIA for the past few days

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any Intel on England or Germany?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: England is worried about being caught in the middle of you and Germany. And
Germany is just happy that we've tied up Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Cool- makes sense. It has been very quiet lately, which is concerning me greatly.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I think that's just because it's the weekend. I imagine it'll pick back up once
orders start going through


1902, Winter:

enthusiastic to work with you.

1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Are you attacking Italy?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I love to see you working with Russia against Turkey. I'm assuming a retreat to
Ukraine with the idea of taking Rumania?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: By the way, what is your plan with the Adriatic Sea? Will you be fighting Italy?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: That was mainly to stop Turkey getting a foothold there

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It might work in our favor actually if the plan is to dislodge Turkey from the
Ionian- we have a total of 4 fleets to his 3.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Looks like: Ukraine-Rumania Moscow S Sevastopol H Budapest S Serbia H Serbia S
Ukraine-Rumania Galicia S Ukraine-Rumania  will guarantee you Rumania

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What is your relationship with Italy like? I thought you two were fighting by
bouncing in the Adriatic so much 😅

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I'm happy to help the cause and I've told Italy my moves each turn, but I still
feel like I don't know what the plan is here. (Is there even a plan?)

1904, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: This game is going very well for you. You have zero threats and allies all around
you. You are highly likely to take Bulgaria and/or Greece this year

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: We should talk about borders- if you can move your fleet from the Adriatic to
Albania it would help you capture Greece, and I'd have no problems staying out of Tyrolia
and Trieste if you are willing to do the same.


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thoughts?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Not sure why Italy disbanded Ionian, but I figure he may have missed the deadline
for builds

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: We need to move quickly if we still want to get the edge on Turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Also, any thoughts on Russia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
austria: I'm fine with keeping out of Tyr and Tri to maintain a dmz between us  I'm not
100% sure about Russia at the moment, I feel as though as soon as Turkey is gone he will
move against me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good. I agree, I would definitely not leave yourself open to being stabbedd
by Russia if possible

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: It looks like you are aiming to take Venice? Meanwhile, Turkey has a walk into
Tunis and will only get stronger. Maybe we should try to cooperate instead of fight?


1905, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What gives with the move to Trieste?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
austria: Ngl, completely forgot about it being a dmz. I'm not attacking you dw

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Ok- I can trust that since I think taking the Ionian and/or Albania is a priority
for you


1905, Winter:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Damn- I seriously did not intend to take Trieste. I had figured I would want to
stay in Venice for the time being with you bordering it with two units and didn't think I
would actually end up there

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: If there is absolutely anything I can do to help you with my army in Trieste, it's
your unit to order

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: I guess just pull back to Venice?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: Sure- especially if Italy keeps Piedmont, that might be the move. I am also happy
to help support Budapest to hold so that you don't lose it to Russia. Speaking of which, I
am assuming you are disbanding the Adriatic Sea? It doesn't seem to be very useful since
Turkey will be able to keep it out of the Ionian anyway.


1906, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Any more thoughts now that builds have been put down?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: If you can support a hold in Budapest, could I take Venice for the time being?
I'm getting rather weak as it goes

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I feel like you should have kept Albania instead of Adriatic. Putting the fleet in
Venice only moves us backwards

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I can't stop you from moving to Venice though I do feel like you are better off
putting it on the front lines

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
austria: Disbanding Albania was a mistake, I'll admit

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I was assuming a move like that meant you might be working with Turkey again,
which would probably be a huge help for you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Darn, we weren't on the same page last turn, but I'm super glad to see you work
with Turkey again

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Russia is in a really good position to wipe you off the map so I would definitely
try to slow him down. I'll do what I can in the North

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Just as a sidenote, I noticed you held in Budapest, but it could have potentially
supported Serbia to Rumania.


1906, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sorry, the bot was down for a short bit. If you support Budapest to hold with
Serbia and Turkey cuts Rumania, you'll keep Budapest: otherwise you probably will lose it
to Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Congrats on keeping Budapest!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: We can definitely keep pushing back Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Turkey and Russia both told me that they want to eliminate you and England and go
for a 3 way draw

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: I'm not sure I'm very interested in that because we only just started making
progress against Russia, and Russia/Turkey alliance is always scary and may be able to
overpower me in the long run (they don't want to give me any of the builds)

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: Would you be willing to support Tunis to the Ionian Sea in the Spring? Also, I can
give you Trieste in the fall in exchange for Vienna if that's alright with you.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Not sure what the best disband is. Probably either Budapest or Adriatic


1907, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I think: Budapest-Rumania Serbia S Budapest-Rumania   Gives you the highest
chances of surviving from Russia/Turkey onslaught this turn

go to Denmark. If we could share that would be great! I would preffer if you went there

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

need something in return. I love the alliance between you me and France, but taking
Denmark doesn't really benefit anybody but you. I would be willing to support you into
Denmark, if  you move your fleet in the Norwegian west. I really don't like the look of
all three of your fleets hovering over Scandinavia. If I support you into Denmark, and you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Also I agree with our triple alliance. That will be very helpful for everyone

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Why would you bounce? Hel is a much more powerful postition

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
england: I'm not exactly sure but France proposed it and I'm rolling with the flow

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: ?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: Sorry. I really am. I hope our alliance can maybe continue?? I was talking with
France and a ton of the stuff didn't match up, and I was worried you would attack me. I
should have let you know, as it is clear you only told the truth.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
england: What didn't match up?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: Stuff like the bounce in English Channel

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: But what if I move out of Norway and let you get it back. Could that  save our
alliance?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok, I need to go now, but we can talk in the morning?>

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah let's talk then.


1902, Winter:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello. If you leave Nor this turn our alliance will survive for the time being.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Again, sorry for the stab. In hindsight, I can't really say it was a mistake. Even
though I feel bad I REALLY needed the build as Austria and Turkey are running a relentless
attack against me. I appreciate you're cooperation. I fear if we go to war, I will be
pressured from all sides and will be eliminated. But, that would probably also end the
alliance with you and France, and they are looking in a much better position then you
right now. So I would really like to continue our alliance. I will move out of Nwy this
turn, provided you don't take Sweden.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: If I have Norway and Denmark I am content.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Lovely. I have been talking to france, and in the interest of keeping you strong
to fight Austria and Turkey, I surrender any german centers except Denmark to you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I don't blame you for stabbing me, because it's reasonable to play aggressively
if you think you're cornered. That said, my movements last turn ought to indicate that
you're not cornered, so I am hoping we can return to normal relations. I am interested in
the current FER alliance to counter AT and would prefer it survives.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Actually, I just looked at the map again. You can keep Nor for now.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'd rather you fight AT in the East rn, and it looks like you do need every
single center you can get. I'll keep denmark but Nor is yours.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Wow

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: That’s really nice

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Thank you!! 😊

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: What tile specifically?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Lol. I meant SKA

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: I really hope you don't stab me. It would probably mean the end of both our
nations.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Nevermind. I won't move into Ska. Wouldn't be a good move anyways. Ideally I would
move into Nth and you would move NTH to helgoland, where we could both attack Germany but
I realize that you might not trust me enough to do that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: I'm moving Edi into NTH, and NTH into helgo

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I won't stab you. If you're peaceful from here on out I'm chill to be peaceful
like I have been

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok. Are you ok with me moving to nth?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I will be peaceful. Would be in my best interests not to be anyways

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: By nth you mean North Sea right? If so don't move there. My Edi Fleet is going
into North Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: To support south

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yes, that's what I mean

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Won't move there then

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Want me to support you from Edi to NTH?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: nothing else for my fleet to do

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

Bohemia-Munich  Burgundy-Ruhr  English Channel S Picardy-Belgium  Picardy-Belgium
Helgoland-Holland  North Sea S Helgoland-Holland

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Enlands idea above

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright thanks

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: So I have a very weird proposition for you. What are your thoughts on me
convoying an army into Livonia to help support you defending centers? I figure that France
will hold the Med, so it's up to you and me to hold and push in the east.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Idk... that seems like a very precarious position for me to be in if your army is
in Livonia.... and although I would like this alliance to last a long time, we can't
really know when/if our alliance will end and when it does if you have an army in liv...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: while I appreciate the offer I just don't think I can trust you with basically the
fate of my country depending if you stab me or not

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: also just some intel I think Italy is a really bad player...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So what do you think about the future of this alliance? What happens when/if we
are both large superpowers?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: That's fair on the Livonia idea lol. It sounded interesting but I'd probably
decline too.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: What makes you say that about Italy?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: And I am 1000% down to draw this out with FER, but if I get stabbed obviously I'm
going to make it my life goal to be insanely inconvenient.

russia: Sweet! I'm just wondering about all your troops... where are they going to go? I
feel like to only people you are in a good position to attack is me and France, which
makes this sort of awkward 🙃

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: Lmao I've been talking to France about that. Going to convoy to Italy and see the
world a bit

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: Stabbing either you or France would get me right solidly dead so I'm not looking
to start a right

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Lol how are you going to convoy to Italy???

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: I believe you it's just you don't have enough fleets to get there. Trust me, I
like this alliance too.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I know it sounds dumb 😂😂 France wants me to convoy via my and his fleets

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
england: Let me find what move he said he wanted hold up

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright how do you wanna split up Germany?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

move is.

england really sucks...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah it blows lol. I guess I'm just gonna sit around. On the bright side side,
even if I pushed out of mainland Europe I can just chill

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hi england; sorry I havn't gotten back to you. I'm really sorry I did that, and I
feel kinda bad since I really like you as a player. You were in a really tough predicament
there, with all you're troop builds, and nowhere to put them. And as much as would have
loved to continue our alliance, you can see how tricky the predicament was. If the
situation allows, I would be totally open to something in the future.

hang out until the draw lmao

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Greetings from the South! Hope you are doing well! Wondering if we might be able
to build a good relationship. Do you prefer to bounce in the black sea?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hey just replying to your message on backstabbr, happy to work together. So will
you go to gal and ukr? I think we should still bounce in the black sea as it won't be
great to make it obvious that we are working together...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hi Turkey! I would love to have a good relationship between our two great
countries! Are you up for blitzing Austria? Looking forwards to a great game with you!
-Russia

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
russia: I think we should leave the Black Sea as a DMZ, as I would like to 100% ensure I
get Rum and I'm worried about Austria taking it. So if we can agree to leave it as a DMZ I
can move my fleet to rum

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Hmm ok that sounds fine,makes sense. As long as you're willing to help me take bud
within the next couple of years and I'll return the favour for vie. What's your read on
Italy in all of this?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: He says that he and Austria have reached a truce for tyr


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Hey so I ended up going to the black sea defensively because of all the info I was
getting from Austria that you were planning to attack me. Not sure whether you actually
are or whether you had the same sort of information from them that I was planning against
you. I'm hoping its the latter as we have a great opportunity to carve up Austria given
their very passive start. They should only get one build so they will be behind.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Austria was telling me that you were going to attack me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Wait what?!?!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Austria is telling you imma attack you?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I agree w/ the great opportunity to get them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Alright, well that just isn't true. I guess they want to try and keep us from
becoming allies. How about this - you take Rum with support and I take the Black Sea. I
get BLA for insurance and you get Rum which gives you an extra build. I will try for
Greece and might get it then we will be set up to attack Austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: To be honest, I don't really want you to have BLA. I'm just not there yet
(although probably will be eventually). So what if I move to rum supporting myself, and
you can attempt to trick Austria to support you into gre.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: The ideal would be if I moved into Gal this turn, which would put tremendous
pressure on Austria. But this would only work if my fleet moved too Rum, and you supported
it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If your working with Austria and betraying me I swear...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Your basically for sure my ally now. Early in the game I was debating an alliance
with Austria, but they seem to be spreading a lot of misinformation, and are asking for
very unreasonable things. I think they still think I'm allied with them, so maybe I could
persuade them not to move into rum and then you wouldn't even have to support me? If that
worked it would be amazing as we would each get a build (I would actually get two).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I'm spreading some rumors about me being allied with Austria, hoping the news get
back to them so don't be alarmed if somebody says something about that to u

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: OK I understand your hesitancy over BLA. Yes, Austria is spreading a lot of
misinformation, to Italy as well as us. There are three things here and I can only give up
one otherwise I'm putting myself under way too much risk. Its either 1) you taking RUM by
yourself and I wont try and stop it 2) black sea DMZ (but we'd need to bounce it) 3) me
supporting you into Rum. Whichever one you take, I can't give up any of the others. I
would be too far onto the back foot with you getting a freebe in the North and Austria
seemingly coming for me. 1902 will be a big year and if we work this out and we play it as
allies then we can both have a lot of trust going into next year which will  be really
valuable.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I would really like a lot of trust between us, as our alliance can be insanely
powerful. I'm going to take Rum, and PLEASE don't stop me. But you don't need to support
me either. I don't see why you would want BLA if not  too attack me?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: 😭

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Ah very difficult to work out what was going to happen there after the first
season. I knew I had to at least not give up the Black sea as that would be terrible for
me. I had to protect it. It doesn't mean we have to be in all out war though. I just got
too paranoid I guess.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Mhm.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Right

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: obviously I can totally trust you, right?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: I'm willing to be allies with you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: But I just can't believe that you were "protecting yourself" by moving to the
black see. And as for your message before, 1 and 2 are just normal things that we would do
in an alliance, those don't harm you at all." 1) you taking RUM by yourself and I wont try
and stop it 2) black sea DMZ (but we'd need to bounce it) 3) me supporting you into Rum. "

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing

that sound fair?

1902, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Oh it seems I didn't send that message off. I guess that's why you went ahead and
attacked me in rum

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: For me?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Oops. I meant Greece. So ig ur going to attack me in Sev. Last chance to crush
Austria?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Ok yes let's do it. I think they are after me anyway

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
turkey: I'll support you into bud

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: Great. I will support you into Sur next turn then

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: lol turkey

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
turkey: I did not have enough time to change my orders. Plus I didn't know which army to
support... We needed more time.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok. Try again next turn


1903, Spring:

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
russia: I think I will move Moscow into War, with Sil supporting, where I could go for
Austria the following turn.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
russia: Also I will move Ukraine to gal. Could you support me there?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
russia: This is where we need to trust each other. I will be leaving Mos undefended and I
need you not to stab me


1903, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sorry, got all this way too late. I really have no idea whether you're actually
willing to work with me or not at this point but I am open to ideas.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: I would like to work with you. I realize that you and Austria have an alliance
against me, but so far you guys haven't done that much(although I will admit you have me
anoyed 😤). Right now, you could lie to me, tell Austria your plans, and stab me, but I
think that the better option for both of us is to work together against Austria. It seems
like they totally trust you, and have left many territories undefended. Currently me and
Italy have an alliance, and together the 3 of us could rip through Austrias territory, as
they aren't expecting it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If you are up for this, I think the ideal attack would be: Aeg - Gre Ion s Aeg -
Gre Rum - Ser Bul s Rum - Ser Con - Bul Sev - Rum

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: This would garuntee you two of Austria supply centers, unless Austria does
something very weird.  I could support myself into Gal, and attempt to move for Vie.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So, what do you think? Up for leaving you Austrian ally behind and siding with me?
Our alliance, if it works, could be a monumental one

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: You still around?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Im up for this if you can confirm - so you want to take back Sev though right?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And is Italy on board?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Italy is on board.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: I would like to have sev back, yes. I would be willing to give you support
sometime in a future turn if you let me have sev back.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: I would almost think that you are controlling Austria and turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Your absolutely ridiculous.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: You have such a good chance to stab Austria, and your practically doing nothing
against me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: And I think I have lost count of how many times you have stabbed me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: I was honestly ready this time. I thought we had more time. I needed more time to
sort it out with Italy. I see they didn't support me so luckily I didn't get the moves
changed.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Mhm

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: You’ve only said that, oh, how many times?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: If I don't hear from you, then lets leave this until next year. I need
confirmation otherwise its too risky.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I told you I needed confirmation otherwise it was too risky. I didn't get
confirmation from Italy and there you go, too risky wouldn't have worked.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And you tell me Italy is on board and next minute they are asking me to support
them into Greece

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok fine. You didn't really do any damage to me anyways

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: But now we have the whole weekend to work this out.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: And ultimatly, I don't really care anymore what you do'

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: but if you attack me again I won't be up for negation anymore

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: OK but I can't give up SEV, not yet anyway. Way too dangerous. Move into GAL and
I'll support you into BUD in the fall

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
russia: You're funny. Why is giving up Sev "way too dangerous? It's not like me having it
gives me access to very much of your territory... it is Russian territory after all. You
are already a very powerful country, and if you do as I suggest, moving into Gre and
Serbia, you could have nine supply centers. If you give me Sev, I will support you into
Bud

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: So I think the ideal would be something like: Ion - Gre Aeg s Ion - Gre Rum - Ser
Bul s Rum - ser Sev - Rum

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sev is too dangerous because Sev to Arm together with your ally Italy by sea and
its basically and I just lost Austria as an ally. In the short-term then you have 3 to
attack RUM with. Also, you think I can hold off you, Italy and Austria at the same time? I
don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as you're suggesting. Also, why
would I be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally Italy to come
back at me by sea. And I don't know where you get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then you're really
going to support me into RUM in the fall *as well* as the 2 I got from Austria? So you get
1 and I get 3, that's really the deal you're happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but
we both know you have no intention of supporting me into RUM in the Fall. You will be
attacking RUM with 3 while Italy tries to push through by sea. It doesn't take a genius to
see that. Next time try and suggest a deal that actually has some appearance of sincerity
otherwise it's just too easy to see through.


1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not
a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I
didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves,
we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you
look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and
b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody,
haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it
doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and
are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: If what you say about you and Austria not having an alliance anymore is true, then
it looks like you don't have any friends at all close to you. And I know you're feeling
very strong right now, but you will lose all of that if you don't have a powerful
alliance. We are both strong countries, and a war would basically mean both of us getting
put out of the game

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: For the record, I don't think you can hold off me, Austria, and Italy at the same
time. Definitely not. And although I have no interest in an alliance with Austria, they
will be my second option if you continue to be this bellicose.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also can you read? I never suggested Sev to Arm, nor did I ever say I would
support you into Rum. Make sure you get the facts straight before you go on a rant like
that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: And one last thing. If everything happened like I said we should do it, you would
have 8; 6 + 1(serbia) + 1(greece) + 1(bulgaria) -1(sev). But that doesn't mean I only get
one. Have you noticed my units in Munich and Silesia by any chance? I think you were
overreacting.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: So, I'm still up for an alliance. I think it would be in both of our best
interests, and could be very powerful" But you need to stop constantly saying shit like"oh
we never really worked it out" or "oh, I'm sorry it was too close to the adjudication
period", and then completely running over my ideas as soon as I say them. Sure, they
weren't 100% ideal, or truthful. But we can talk, and work out the kinks instead of you
going on this rant about how bad and unrealistic the plans are.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I know you didn't say anything about sev to arm, that's your army I'm talking
about having the potential to move there but more likely you just attack rum. And yeah I
meant your offer to support me into bud not rum. That's what you said you would do but I
can't beleive you would do that so don't include  it in the offer.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ok, probably true

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: But you can't know that lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So ummm.... do you want to try to make something worK?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Sure

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Watch me trust you and get burnt. Looking forward to it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: I'll back off and attack Italy and you attack austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Can't give up sev though but you'll probably be able to take it anyway.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Lol actually I was thinking "watch me you and get burnt"

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Great minds think allike I gues

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So what are our short term plans? I still strongly think you should take Serbia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also, just letting you know, I'm telling austria that I'm going to attack you and
that I want to make an alliance to attack you, just thought I would let you know. Ofc it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: Army StP? Good luck with that one 🙂 We had a chance vs France but you and Austria
don't. I'll have the black sea this year and i'll be the Turkish Turtle for the rest of
the game 👍

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: LOL. Some of you're own medicine turkey. I just can't believe how many times you
said you would do something and then you didn't... Why would me and you have a better
chance against france than me and austria?  And havn't you noticed my alliance... Well,
good luck turkey. I can't see us doing anything together for the rest of the game if I'm
going to be completely honest.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Did you see my moves last season? They were exactly as I said. Thanks though, good
luck to you too. You've got a good chance now to win! 😃

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok, now that I look at the moves again ig u didn't do anything you didn't say you
would. But you didn't do anything that would benifit us, lke going for serbia or gre.
Whatever, doesn't matter now. And who knows, if a miricle happened you could turn this
game around and win it too!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hey, france is getting huge. I'm not suggesting an alliance as it appears nothing
works against us, but maybe we could set some of our disputes to allow us to focus our
energy on trying to prevent france from winning?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
russia: If you give me berlin back, I can support you into edi

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I will happily do everything in my power to get you Berlin back :)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: WOW. I couldn't tell you how much that means to me!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Lol but I would like to prevent France from winning. Can't do much though from
where I am.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeh. taking med tho

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Would b good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Would be great if I could. I agree.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: Realistically, nobody is going to be able to win before 1910, except maybe france
has a tiny chance? Anyways, I know that we mutually have absolutly no trust for eachother
but I think the most strategic  option right now is to put our differences aside and
elliminate austria + england and go for the 3 way win

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Remember, the game is hardcapped 1910

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: So france has shown a lot of interest with me trying to get me u and them to go
for the 3 way, which I think is a good idea... but if u do want to go for it we will have
to be on the lookout because there is a good chance france is lieng and is going to try to
go for the solo

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: France is on 15. They have won this game easily. He only needs three more. He
could even do it this year. Nap, Lon at least. Get an army into the UK and next year will
be done very easily. He was also telling me the same thing but if he doesn't go for the
win he's crazy. I'll lock in 3 way draw no problem but this game will be over next year
with a French win no matter what we do.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: eh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If austria works with me we can basically take a center from france this turn

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: I think we might be able to do

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: it

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: No other options, really,

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: SO I say we keep talking to france about plans for our 3-way, but then work out
something with austria and go against our word to try to draw it

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: There arn't really any other options

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sure, happy to do whatever. Throw everything at France because, really, its our
duty not to just give in. Die fighting. Can you support Ser into Tri? I wont make any play
for Sev. I should have built another fleet. That was dumb.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Or get him to support you into tri. I wont cut any. Then you can give him Vie
back. 1 for 1. I'll just lose Nap and keep that fleet in Apu to help vs Ven.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: yeh, just wainting on a message from austria so we can coordinate

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Alright, let me know what you want me to do - I'm just locking in Gre to Alb to
help with Tri in the Fall if needed. Holding everywhere else.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: shouldn't we eliminate austria? This wouldn't harm us; in fact we would get our
troops up there to fight france, and it would be a 3 or 4 way win instead of a 4 or 5 way

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: let me know if i'm wrong

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: this is just me thinking how to stop france

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hellooo?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
turkey: I don't think so. Better with all of us vs France. But wither way France wins so
whatever you like.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: Austria isn’t responding which is rly a problem

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: I'll support gal into bud then

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Let me know if that's cool

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok. Put that in your orders. But if I get a message from Austria saying they want
me to support them to try I won’t move into bud, so be prepared for a last-minute message

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: It reallys sucks we didn't get a hand on austria... with them we definitly could
have taken tri

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: U know what

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: lets let them have tri this spring

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: its still the spring

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: so u take serbia from them, and I support myself into bud

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: that way it wont seem like im betrahing france, and we are ready to take tri next
turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Is taht good?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Oh god were running close to the deadline

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Btw if u betray me I will just be baffled at how self interested you are

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Alright I'll change my order

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: k

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: do u like the plan?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sure, would be good to be in tri in the spring though so we can put pressure on
ven but stick to that. Destroy Austria.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hmm you didn't move out of Bla and against france? Ig I understand why u completly
dont trust me but I feel that was a poor decision

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Do you seriously think it would make any difference at all? I'm honestly asking.
This game has been over for 2 seasons at least. It doesn't matter what we do now. Do you
see the freebies in England? Who might be able to take those? Its first to 18 and France
is on 15. Good on you for fighting to the end, but this game is over!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'd love to work with you this game- not sure what your thoughts are, but in my
opinion Russia and France are the two countries who are the most natural allies on the
board

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Hi France! I completely agree with you - Russia and France really are great
allies. For now we might not have to much to do with eachother, but I would love to have
an alliance with you! How is it looking in the north? Are you thinking of teaming up with
England or germany? I would recommend england as an ally, as I have heard rumours of
germany trying to takey you out. Looking forwards to a great game!  -Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds great! I took your advice and am working things out with England. Hopefully
we can keep things balanced between them and meet up somewhere in the middle.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Them being England and Germany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any thoughts on your south? A Russia/Turkey alliance could work well since I think
that Austria and Italy may be fighting early on.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hmm. Do you know any more info about that?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Unfortunately not, Turkey has been unwilling to share their plans


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hmm. Are you still allied with England? They did a pretty anti - Russian move
there.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think England's moves might actually lean more pro Russia given that the army
move failed and England will have to put a fleet in Norway. An army in Norway would be a
lot more anti-Russian for sure.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That being said I am trying to see if England would be interested in making some
anti-German moves which can help get England off of your back

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What's the scoop regarding Turkey/Austria? Looks like everyone made relatively
conservative openings

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: I'm with Austria. Going for turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Umm. Well, that's not good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Why is that?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Obviously not anymore though

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: It looks like Austria helped Turkey against you, and Turkey stabbed you

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: I was actually allies with them both and was going to stab Austria but ig not

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I wonder if attacking Turkey with Austria is still on the table given Italy's
position to help with Bulgaria and/or Rumania. Italy has a highly vested interest in
seeing you do well too.


1902, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Have you and England talked at all about taking Denmark from Germany?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Turkey's builds are looking pretty good for you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hopefully you both made up?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I'm not sure if me and turkey are allies anymore... If you want, you could clear
the order with turkey, and move munich into Tyr, where you could help take Austria out.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Sure, if I have a retreat I definitely plan to move there

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: By the way I've been spreading misinformation by saying that you will move to
Silesia (just thought I'd give you a heads up)


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Darn, it looks like Turkey is really committed to attacking you which is too bad.
Is Austria willing to work with you? This might be the best chance you both have of taking
Rumania so I've strongly suggested to Austria that they support Galicia to Rumania.  I
figure that cutting Rumania support is the best chance you have of keeping Sev, though
Turkey has it guaranteed if they simply cut Ukraine support.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: By the way, what are your thoughts regarding what you plan to do with Sweden?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Are you willing to work with Austria?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You there still?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Do you have information on German or English plans? Some Intel would really help
at this point

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Hi france. I just got back from a long weekend, but now I will always be here ☺️.
England wants me to attack Germany in Denmark, and said that you had requested that. Is
that true? No idea about Germany as they are not responing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Italy seems like they are messing up a lot. They had 3 invalid orders, so I don't
know how strong of an ally they might be

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: What about you? Got any intel?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I would love to work together with Austria, as I think it would be a very powerful
alliance. But I fear I can't stop turkey and Austria from continuing to attack me. Also
I'm a little worried about England 😰.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hmm. I was under the impression that England would attack Denmark and that he
wanted you to support him into Denmark.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yes. But did you request that?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Sorry mistyped above. I meant England moving into denmark.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Well, I assumed England would do it anyway because it should be a guaranteed
supply center. England and I have been talking a lot

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think if you move to Norway you'll be better off, I didn't ask England to get
you to support him I don't think but I did ask England to move to Denmark (otherwise I'd
worry what else those fleets are up to)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yes. Me and England are on pretty good terms as well, but I really hope they don't
attack me. What do you think the likelihood of that is? I think later in the game an
alliance between me, you, and England could be insanly powerful.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: My hope is that England supports himself into Denmark

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: True

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: True

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hmm. It's honestly really tough to read England. I don't think they are going
after you but they did mention taking Sweden earlier int he game so I might request a
bounce in Norway or something like that

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: So you think I should move to nwy? And do you think I should arrange a bounce or
use it to stab. I don't really want to attack England

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Hmm. If you don't really want to attack England I would arrange a bounce probably.
I don't know what Norwegian Sea is up to but it is probably best if it stays there

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: There isn't a ton of time before the deadline so I'm not sure if England is online
or not

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I told England to move from nwg to Edinburgh and they agreed in return for me
support a move to denmark

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: How close are you with England?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Sweet. That works fine as long as England follows through

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also rn I don't have any things I need w/ Warsaw. Anywhere you would like me to
move it?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I feel like if everything works out our alliance could last a long time and has
potential to become very powerful.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I don't actually think I'm that close to England right now, but we talk a lot.
He's said he will help me against Germany and I am somewhat skeptical of whether he will
follow through or not

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I don't thing Germany has many friends 💀

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If I move to Silesia with war, I could help you w/ germany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'd love to see that honestly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Alright. Hopefully in return for support I could have Berlin and you would get the
rest of Germany?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Especially if the three of us work things out, you could drop down to the Baltic
Sea and we'd be able to split Germany very quickly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That sounds good to me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Right. But things might not work out that great if I move into Nwy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Haha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I'm kinda worried about attacking England, since that would mean England, Austria,
and turkey all going after me and I don't think I can handle that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I need to go, but I'll be back in 10  min if you wana keep talking 😁

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Here's a thought. If we're taking down Germany, it would make sense for you to
support England to Denmark

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: And then England moves North Sea to Helgoland, Norwegian Sea to North Sea, and
Skaggerak to Denmark

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Unfortunately it seems that England is not online

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Do you know which unit England wanted to move to Denmark with?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yea I don't want to attack England. I think I will support instead.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Perfect. I agree with your decision. After a brief convo with England I'm a lot
less concerned about things because enow the stories are all matching up

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Soo... you did just talk to England, correct. Cuz I just messaged them and they
are for sure online

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Yep I did talk to them. I think they were having connection issues earlier which
is why I thought they were offline

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: they say they are bouncing North Sea in EC

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Checks out. We organized a bounce rhere

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Wait by EC do you mean the English Channel?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yep

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Sorry about me moving into Norway. I was pretty worried they would attack me and
some things didn’t match up. Also I really needed the build. Now I feel bad cuz they we’re
completely honest 😭. Hopefully England will accept my apology and we can continue our
alliance?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Honestly the build was worth it I think. Asutria and Turkey are seriously strong
together and stopping them will be a lot harder than I first thought

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yes. Thx for understanding.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Turkey is crazy. They try to make a deal with me and they betray every time.
Austria won’t respond to my messages. And basically nobody can help me over there. So
hopefully I will be able to hold them off and get some extra builds from Germany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I wish Italy was a better player then they could help

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Anyways I need to go to bed now but talk in the morning

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Omfg turkey is ridiculous.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: They just said “ i did not have enough time to change my orders. Alliance still
on”

Homeland effectively

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Do you have relations with either rturkey or Austria?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What's the deal with Norway?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: England says the alliance might work if I move out of nwy, which I probably will,
since I can't have another enemy. Turkey thinks I am very gullible, and keeps saying we
will attack Austria, but he is 100% lying. Austria won't respond to my press. I messed up
with that retreat. Imma build in Moscow

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown

currently defending it and imagine any supports it gives will be cut.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Can Bohemia head to Munich to cut Munich support though? I want to get clever and
see if I can get away with this move but it relies on Munich's support being cut.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also do you have any reads on England? I could move into Ska but only if I'm sure
they won't attack

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Sure. Do you want me to go as for as to support my move into Munich, or do you
think Sil should head back to War instead?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: HellO?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Not a good read on England right now. But he told me he wouldn't attack you if
that helps

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I would not move Silesia to Warsaw because you want to make sure Ukraine has a
valid retreat option

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I don't think a supported move on Munich will work right now, but that's what I'd
lean towards unless you want to do a tactical pull back with Moscow-Livonia Ukraine-Moscow
and silesia-Warsaw

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Nah

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: silesia could also go to Galicia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

france: Here's a tentative plan for the fall: Kiel-Berlin Bohemia-Munich Silesia S
Bohemia-Munich Burgundy-Ruhr English Channel S Picardy-Belgium Picardy-Belgium Helgoland-
Holland North Sea S Helgoland-Holland

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: This guarantees you Munich (unless something weird like Austria moves Galicia to
Silesia??).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It guarantees England Holland and guarantees me Belgium. And England already has
Kiel.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Basically, Germany loses 4 dots in one turb

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: And if Ukraine goes to Warsaw, I think you'll be well defended and can build
(since you are picking up munich) in St Petersburg. This way, you'll be able to defend
Warsaw and Moscow too

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thoughts? There may be room for refinements.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Sorry, gtg to bed. Talk in morning

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any new thoughts so we don't run too close to the deadline again 😅

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeh I agree. I like your plan.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: And Ig mos would just move to sev?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: bwahahahaha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I'm trying to get turkey to work with me. If they actually do that would be
AMAZING as first we could crush Austria and then I could stab them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Moscow to Sev makes sense

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It would be great if Turkey did that! Though I worry Turkey might not go for that
as my communication this year with him made it seem like Turkey was not interested in
stabbing Austria.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I sent England the orders u sent me btw

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: yea. All they have done this game is stab me, so I would be suprised if they
actually did't lie this time.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I feel like turkey might be on board... we’ll see soon. If he is, Austria will
lose two supply centers. If he’s not, I should be ok

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Nice!!! Had we known about the German NMR, we could have eliminated him this turn.
That being said, this is still good.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What are you thinking for builds? It depends on how you feel about England, but if
you can trust them then A Warsaw would make sense

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Rn I'm just laughing  at Austria and turkey

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: Turkey had such a good chance to stab Austria, he could have gotten two of their
territories and put them out of the game, but instead he continues his war with Austria
against me and they can't even capture any territories 😂.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Idk about England so far they have been completely honest but they just asked me
if they could convoy one of their armies into Livonia so they could help help defend my
centers but I don't think I trust them enough for that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah haha, I think you might even have the chance to retake Sebastopol next year
at this rate

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: On second thought, you might need the unit in Livonia honestly. It looks like
Austria is intent on taking Bohemia, supporting themselves to Silesia, to then cut Warsaw
support to take Ukraine, and then take Moscow. It's a 3 season maneuver, but it honestly
is what is going to happen.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I just asked Turkey why he isn't stabbing Austria. He replied that he is playing
to solo. So I guess his thought is that he'll keep Austria as a puppet for the entire game
and hopefully eek out enough progress to then brutally stab Austria on the last turn.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: With these kinds of players, you kind of have to just hunker down and form
coalitions to fight against them... and honestly the only reason it is working is Italy is
just letting them make so much progress in the Med.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I am having trouble keeping in contact with Italy, but what I want to do is work
with him closely in the Med and put up a lot of fleet pressure in the south.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If you can get in touch with Italy, it would be awesome to try and convince him to
help with that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: k

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We should start planning our moves

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also what are you thinking for the future of our alliance?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: For sure. It does depend a little bit on English builds, but I honestly think that
for the short term future we should be applying pressure on Austria and Turkey until they
are forced to fight each-other.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: On my side, I'll be trying to work with Italy. If Italy remains uncooperative, I
may have to move to attack them.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What are your thoughts though?


1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I am pretty confident that Austria will support Bohemia to Silesia. For that
reason, I recommend: Warsaw S Silesia H  Munich-Berlin Kiel S Munich-Berlin Burgundy-
Munich

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'll send this to England as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thoughts?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: The safest way would be something like this: Warsaw S Ukraine Moscow S Ukraine
Munich S Silesia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: New thought: Ukraine-Sevastopol Moscow S Ukraine-Sevastopol Warsaw-Galicia Silesia
S Warsaw-Galicia Munich-Berlin Kiel S Munich-Berlin Burgundy-Munich  This move set has all
of the advantages of both move sets

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok, I'm here now. I know I have said this every time, but I think I might have
something with turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We are working stuff out rn. They said they arn't in an alliance with austria
anymore which, based off last turns moves, is totally plausible.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also, what do you think about turkey? If you have looked at their moves throughout
this games and their alliances (basically none) it seems evident that either they arn't
very committed to the game, or they are just bad at it. I have communicated with them a
few times, but they don't really seem interested in talking.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I like you're moves. Although would Burgundy to munich be permanant? Or just
moving through?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also I think you should go to war with Italy. They are weak, play bad, and are
getting closed in on from all sides(if you attack them). Try not to let turkey get all
their territories and become to strong 😅

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I was thinking that, I am waiting for replies from Italy and England first though.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ok

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Think I should try to play austria and turkey against eachother for Rum so I am
garunteed to get it (if austria attacks)?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I am looking to get another build soon to get another fleet on Italy, so as long
as you were taking Berlin, and it looks like you aren't in immediate trouble, it would
make sense to make the trade as I feel it is a bit more natural. But it's a bit to early
to definitively say

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: If you can get them to fight that would be ideal, but I am 99% sure Turkey is
lying

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: how so?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I'm paraphrasing, but Turkey told me he was not going to attack Austria because he
wants to eliminate you first

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: oof

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ok

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So is England on board w/ Munich to Berlin?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also did you see england's builds? Given their position they are most likely going
to turn on one of us and recruit the other to help out pretty soon...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: They don't really have anyone to attack but me or you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also I would really preffer you not move into Munich. There is a good chance I
won't get Berlin anyways if england doesn't support

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I haven't heard back on the support to Berlin yet unfortunately so it might be
best to operate on the assumption it will not happen for now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I am currently not moving to Munich, but let me know if England talks to you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Heard anything from England?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You're right, they probably intend to attack one of us. The builds make it
ambiguous to who they plan to fight.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If they do, should we work together too take them out? The builds of only troops
imply a convoy, so I think it would wipe most of their opportunities if we took out NTH...
but then again, they might not attack us

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I can support Norway to North Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: But I agree with your analysis that they want to convoy out, so taking North Sea
would definitely slow them down a lot

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So do you want me to move to the North Sea? They are saying that they are going to
convoy to Italy but that seems implausible...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Up to you, I'm happy to hold

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok sure, let’s wait one more turn. So for England has been true to their word,
so..

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Nice job getting Austria to turn on Turkey!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So, just by the board position we have two options. 1. Take Holland and North Sea
from England this turn. I would bounce Italy out of Munich and you would get a build,
presumably a fleet in St Petersburg. 2. We don't attack England since he's been a very
reliable ally, and commit fully to the attack on Italy and Turkey. This would look like
sending all of my fleets south, so it would mean losing the option to efficiently attack
England later, and also potentially leave us open to being stabbed by England.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any thoughts or suggestions?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Regarding the Austrian retreat from Galicia, I think it makes sense to retreat to
Ukraine and take Rumania from Ukraine. That way, Turkey won't be able to retreat Rumania
to Ukraine.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I sent this to Austria as a recommendation and thought I'd share with you too:
Ukraine-Rumania Moscow S Sevastopol H Budapest S Serbia H Serbia S Ukraine-Rumania Galicia
S Ukraine-Rumania


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Silesia-Warsaw is necessary as well I think in case Austria stabs you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I don't really want to turn on England... but we could

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: They told me you told them you didn't want to convoy their troops, and they said
they didn't know what to do with them

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So what are we doing about munich

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ??

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: France... I need a response to get my orders in. If you see this in time please
move one(w/o) support unit to Munich. Then you might bounce Italy but you might get it
which would be ok to ig

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sorry for the late response

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I was thinking that in order for my armies to be useful, I inevitably need to be
moving through Munich to get to Tyrolia and other key territories anyway, so it seems more
natural to me to have Munich and for you to have Berlin. There is also the fact that I
kind of need a build right now, so if we are not attacking England I would like to have
Munich as you are already picking up Berlin and Sevastopol.


1904, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Awesome- looks like you have one supply center open for building in St Petersburg
and one build, which works out perfectly.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: We need to get you a build this year so you can put a fleet in Sevastopol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Wow you got lucky... got one of my territories and two of Italy’s...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If we’re going to abandon our English ally, I’ll build a fleet... but if not, prob
an army

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So... England, or no?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It's now or never, I say we should go for it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I have to say though, I really like England as a player, so it's a lot tougher of
a call than I'm letting on.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I think though that you could get away with building an army and moving it to
Finland, as to not set off any warning signs. Finland has a lot of advantages including
the ability to defend both Sweden and Norway

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: So I would probably build an army in St Petersburg even if you are on board with
attacking England

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: I also do want to wait for builds since I actually might not be able to even
attack England due to Italy, Austria, and Turkey hating my guts


1905, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: How are things with Austria? Hearing anything interesting lately?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Intial thoughts: Moscow-Sevastopol Sevastopol-Ukraine Galicia-Bohemia Warsaw-
Galicia  This achieves a strong position to corner Italy as well as potentially bounces
with Armenia, allowing you to build F Sevastopol in the winter

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Anti English: Norway-North Sea Berlin-Kiel Munich S Berlin-Kiel Ruhr-Holland
Belgium S Ruhr-Holland English Channel S Norway-North Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: This accomplishes the goal of getting you a build in Kiel, and takes the North
Sea, Holland, and Belgium all in one turn.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If you'd like, we can probably wait to make this move in the fall so that England
will immediately have to pull two units off the board for builds

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I'm up for doing it this turn. Or next. I will also move Stp to Finla d

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good- let's wait a turn then

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok. I will still move to finland this turn ig. Hopefuly that doesn't send off any
alarms to england, though it probably will. but I can say something like "it doesn't
really have anywhere else to go, and it's just for safety seeing as you attacked berlin
last turn"... or something along those lines

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So, if I'm going to be completly honest here(something that doesn't often happen
in this game 🙃), I'm a little bit worried about you getting a few more supply centres and
running off with the game. You took Munich from me, and then also two of italys. Nine
supply centres and a good position. A little bit disturbing, if you can understand. And
no, this doens't mean I'm calling off our alliance, or teaming up with enland,(that would
be stupid of me as they are completely stranded).  So we are both strong countries, and
could probably get away with a two way win, but are you at all interested in that?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: True. If we do it right, a fall stab should be unpreventable even if England does
suspect something.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: I appreciate you bringing up concerns: I would definitely be interested in a two-
way win. It might be comforting to know that the supply center gap is absolutely temporary
as Italy and Austria will work together to push me out of both Rome and Naples (not to
mention, the fact that it ties up 4-5 of my units just to the Italian front). That on top
of getting you a build this year should even things out, if not put things in your favor.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yea. Too early to tell about a lot of this stuff. Here's to a good alliance🥂!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: We should both keep talking to england; maybe suggest some orders that would make
our attack more effective

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: True. Just to be safe, it would be a good idea to dislodge the north Sea and
prevent any convoys. It's going to mean England will know what's up, but I think our
attack is unstoppable anyway. I think I can do this with just Belgium and English Channel

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It might be smart to move Norway-Sweden and St Petersburg-Norway in order to try
and make a play for Denmark too next year

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Oh man I wish I could have seen that in time so we could have coordinated...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Oh well


1905, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: No worries

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I am supporting Berlin to Kiel so absolutely make sure Sevastopol is open for a
fleet build (probably Moscow-Sevastopol and Ukraine-Sevastopol). Also try not to let
Turkey find out, because otherwise he might try to support you into Sev

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any thoughts on what you want to do with Norway?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok sounds good. Nwy will move to Ska maybe to take denmark, since you are already
big and it wouldn't really make sense for you to have it after this turn(so take it this
turn and I'll take it back and support u somewhere else instead) if thats ok with yo

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good regarding moving to Skag. We can definitely organize a way to split up
English supply centers, though I am a bit cautious of doing it now since I expect to be
losing supply centers in the short term (to Austria).


1905, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So you moved to the North Sea. What gives?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yeah last minute I decided that was a better position, since one of us should
probalby occupy it, and it also has access to denmark. I hope that's ok and doesn't come
accross as agressive. I will totally move out of there next turn if u ask me too, since
you have more fleets that need to get out into the sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: But I think that turn went amazing; I got rum from austria, and bounced in sev.
Looks like you did pretty well too. I think if we continue this alliance, we could totally
win

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I think I will go with an army in warsaw, instead of a fleet in Stp, since I broke
off the relationship with austria, and england doesn't seem like a threat. IS that good
with you or would you preffer me to build in Stp, to get Enland out of the game quickly?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Cool- we might be better off with you in the North Sea actually since it opens up
the option to convoy to the island next turn. It depends somewhat on English disbands.
Warsaw is fine with me- I agree with your logic, and we probably have enough units for
England anyway

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Great! Thanks mate


1906, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You didn't build a fleet in Sevastopol?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: The weak point in England's defense is Edinburgh so we should try to find a way to
take that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Oh god I messed up.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Forgot to build

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It happens sometimes. I think you still have a strong position in the south unless
Turkey and Austria start working together again

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thoughts on sending north Sea to Norwegian Sea? I worry that a convoy is easily
distrupted but Edinburgh is easy to take if we do that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any ideas for Trieste?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: How is a convoy easily disrupted? You realize that one has to dislodge a unit in
order to stop it from convoying. And france can't do that. Although Ig they could stay in
edi, but moving to the norwegian wouldn't change anything about that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If you're there we can plan our moves

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I can keep kiel and berlin, right? Since you got the rest of germany. So w/ my
unit in kiel maybe i should go to denmark? Or i could do that with sweden

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Triest could support me into venice?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Do you want me to convoy one of you're units to edi?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Although me moving to venice is pretty risky, if austrai and turkey team up

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: You could say something to austrai about an alliance to try to get them not too
attack you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: sorry for all the messages lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: How about this: A Gal - Vie A Kie A Mos - Sev F NTH A Rum A Swe - Den A Ukr S Rum
A War - Gal  A Tri - Ser A Hol - Edi

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Because England will move Wales to Yorkshire and thus there is no way to convoy to
the island

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: NTH-Norwegian Sea IMO so that I can move my fleet to the North Sea but everything
else seems ok

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ok. Any suggestions? So i'm assuming you will move to serbia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: W/ my fleet in nrth sea i will support you into england if you do me that favor

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: also ig kiel will just chill?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think I have to defend Venice from Austria but I will try to get Austria to make
some bad moves

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I think it makes sense to hold in Kiel

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Maybe move it back to Berlin or something

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: I could move to Serbia it just means I'll lose Venice and Trieste too and
Edinburgh is unfortunately not guaranteed, so I think I'd have to keep Denmark in that
scenario to avoid losing 3 supply centers in one turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: That's not entirly fair... chances are you will loose either venice OR triest

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: And when im in viena i can help u into bud

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So how about we go with what I said, and I don't take denmark this turn but I will
take it next turn(or maybe not) depending on what u have for supply centrs

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: idk what do u think would be best for both of us on the whole

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: That works for me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: k. I won't move to denmark this turn then

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: I really hope you don't betray me as I think that would be bad for both of us in
the long run and if we stick together we are basicaly garunteed a win at this point, but
if we fight it could escalate and we would destroy eachother

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: lol

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: I agree- betraying at this point would be short-sighted. In many ways, you are
better positioned to stab me than I am to stab you since I have so many units tied up in
Italy, Austria, and Turkey.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Well, i can't say I agree with the latter, but I agree with your first point 😘

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: lol france

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
russia: i sorta knew u would do that but I wanted to give u a chance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I have to be honest I’m pretty disappointed about that

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: 😭

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ig I overestimated

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: I know what this looks like, and I think you should make whichever moves make you
more comfortable, but I needed to find a way to convince Austria to work with me against
Turkey in the fall and split them up, so as a condition I put in these moves. That being
said, it's a spring move, and so my plan is to reverse the spring by walking back out of
Kiel and Berlin

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: I have to say that the Austrian moves were an unexpected and great surprise, as it
will be putting massive strains on Turkey and Austria working together in the long run.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: If anything, you have a build in pocket, and are picking up Vienna and Budapest.
If I was going to stab you I would have chosen a different turn and told Austria about you
moving to Vienna


1906, Fall:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: LOL nice try France. If your going to try to persuade me that taking two of my
centers isn't betraying me, then I don't know what too say. And why in the world would you
need Austria to work with you against turkey? You're overrunning the map, and turkey is
probably the least of your concern right now. If you didn't want this too be a betrayal,
you could have told me and worked something out beforehand. And yes, I have a build(s) on
my hand, but unless you actually do as you say, and move out of my centers, I won't really
have a chance for winning. I could have gotten you in Denmark, and although I considered
it I didn't.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: But if you do want to work something out and move out of my centers that would be
pretty nice ...😁

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: I mean, you will definitely be in the draw if that's what you meant. I would have
100% proposed this beforehand, but I felt that the plan might be jeapordized if you
weren't fully on board. I get that you feel like you have to move to defend yourself and
in that sense it unfortunately makes sense for me to hold onto Kiel and Berlin since I
expect to be losing 2 supply centers in the south, and it seems like you aren't interested
in supporting North Sea to Edinburgh.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: Turkey is a cunning player and I fear that with the right tactical positioning
Turkey would be able to conquer the Mediterranean，especially since I only have 3 fleets to
his 4, and considering the superior defensive and offensive position of Turkey on the map
in regards to naval power.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: you keep saying your going to lose centers and you never do... your probably going
to take munich...

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: You say you didn't stab me but you are bieng completly unreasonable in everything
that you are saying.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: In this (not losing centers) I truly have been extraordinarily lucky, but it is
bound to end at some point.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Well you can't know that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So what do you want to do

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: 16 min to figure this out

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: It's just highly unlikely, but I guess it is still theoretically possible for me
to continue growing this turn. Next turn it is impossible as I will no longer be bordering
any supply centers that I can possibly take

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So i'm assuming you're going to take munich?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ANd your unwilling to give me berlin or kiel back?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: My pitch would be eliminating Italy, Austria, and England and going for a 3-way
draw with Turkey since at this point we can't eliminate Turkey by 1910. Not sure what your
relationship with Turkey is like?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I'm open to the possibility of giving back either and/or not taking Munich. I
think it makes sense for me to keep them unless we can figure out a deal with Edinburgh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Also england might be difficult to get down quickly unless we get builds as fleets
and send them over there which kind of feels like a waste

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: OH god, don't get me started on turkey. They are really hard to agree with. But
that is the most likely outcome. Although if you get a few more centers from austria and
stab me u will win.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It's not likely when I'm still on 12, but yeah the other alternative is to keep
either England or Austria alive and settle for a 4 way draw

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: If you want me to trust you I think you should give at least one back, as you are
much bigger and frankly it's probably in your best interest to go for the solo, although
if the rest of the contries cooperate you almost certaintly won't get it. And your
definitly going to need me if you want to go for the draw

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: But no lets not do 4 way

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
russia: |f your going to give me one back I think it would make most sense if I had
berlin, but you would most likely move berlin to Pru or Sil which is scary even in the
most trusting relationship

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That's fair. I agree, the difference between 3 way and 4 way is pretty
significant.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I think a three way is probably possible

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Should I message turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Sure

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Do you know anything about Austria's moves?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Unless you give me back/let me keep one of them, I don't think I will agree to
bieng your ally, and this game will probably end in a 5 way draw hard cap

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: No idea about austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: So berlin will move to silesia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ahh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: 1 minute

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: That's a reasonable position to take- I can give you one back for sure. Though
maybe it makes more sense to support you to Edinburgh for a similar effect and not having
me move to Silesia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ok we have one min change ur orders

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: no time to work out something for edi

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: lol this is stressful

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: next time we need to work out something before this close to adjudication

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: Damn! I changed my orders but they didn't go through for some reason

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Shit

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Yeah that was cutting it way to close

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I don't know if I can believe you but now were fucked

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: this is really bad

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: lost rum

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: and didn't get bud

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That was extremely unlucky in the south, Turkey and Austria guessed completely
correctly somehow

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: ANd wow ur working with turkey?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok I need to go]

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Tmrow maybe we can try to work out a 3 way draw

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Hmm. More like the move mutually benefits us as it means he isn't in the Gulf of
Lyons and also means Italy is eliminated

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: yeh ig

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Alright, we'll talk tomorrow for sure

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Alhtough tbh u might be able to get the solo

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: If you go for it gl

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: The south did go very lucky for me last turn, but I don't think the dots that I
need are within reach for at least a couple years- thanks though lol


1906, Winter:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is unknown
france: So the *best way* to go for the 3 way draw right now would be for me to move North
Sea to Yorkshire and move Skaggerak to North Sea while you convoyed an army from Norway
into Clyde. This way, we can take both London and Edinburgh in the fall, and next year I
would support you to Liverpool

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: In the south you can easily take Serbia and Budapest provided that you can
actually work with Turket

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: What are you thinking for builds? It would kind of make sense to build against
England, but if you are worried about me expanding I would be ok with an army in Warsaw


1907, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: We could convoy Norway to Clyde. Or, if you prefer, I can support Norwegian Sea to
Edi

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Did you work out a plan with Turkey?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Ok i;m here

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
russia: messaged turkey, but they havn't responded yet

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
russia: Ok lets do a convoy into clyde

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Sorry, didn't get a chance to respond to this. I wish you did the convoy, since at
least then you could have gotten Edinburgh.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Turkey made a large oversight in the 3-way draw plans by letting Austria survive
and retreat to Greece

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: I mean, I really didn't expect you to keep to your work

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: It only made sense you would go for the solo

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Your probably going to win but I wont give up 😤

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Fair enough. I made some lucky guesses in the south, but I'm pretty sure you have
me stopped. I have a 3 way draw set, so it will really depend on how fast England gets
eliminated.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Idk... I think youll win. Only need 3 centers and u have like 3 yrs

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: Yea tbh u got insanely lucky

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
russia: and ur a good player

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: We'll see- my luck has to run out at some point ;). Interesting to see that Turkey
still doesn't quite trust you as he stayed in the Black Sea instead of moving it to
Constantinople and against me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello Turkey. I believe we could benefit from coordination as it relates to the
East. Are you open to some level of dialogue on that issue?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hello! I am certainly open to this and welcome the opportunity. How goes diplomacy
with your neighbours?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello! That is wonderful. Diplomacy with my neighbors has been thus far lovely.
How goes yours?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: All pretty civil if a little quiet at this point down in the corner here.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well one thing I can tell you is that Russia is indicating that they are
committing south. Thought you might be interested in that :)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Awesome thanks!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello Turkey! Thank you for what seems to be accurate intel! I am curious as to
how you and Austria are getting along?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Things are up in the air as far as I'm concerned! I don't know what they're up to.
I think Russia has benefited most from the opening season. I would be concerned about
letting them get too much up North

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello France! Our fleets bordering the English Channel seem kind of awkward, but
I'd like to maintain friendly relations with you. Can we agree to go our separate ways and
leave EC free of fleets?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I agree, I think Scandinavia is too important for England to pass up on it. Also,
France struggles to efficiently attack England since I only start with one fleet

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'll be around for more negotiation later today

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright splendid. I will keep my fleet out of EC. Further details can be
discussed later.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Perfect. Sounds great!

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: By the way, have you heard from Germany? They wanted me to attack you so I think
they were trying to get us to fight eachother.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah they were being weird earlier. I was talking about countering Russia in
Scandinavia and they kept insisting that we needed to deal with you first.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'm not sure what they hope to accomplish, but I suspect we're being played.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: Given my communication with them they probably just want us to fight so that they
can take Scandinavia/Belgium for themselves

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright I'll see if i can sus out their plan

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: The Liverpool to London misorder hurts a bit, but otherwise it looks like you are
in a good place

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: The moves indicate that Germany is going after 3 builds, but we could try to stop
that from happening if you are on board?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I thought you could move into a space that was becoming vacant

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: ?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Why did that misorder happen>

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: And I'm talking to Germany to see if I can negotiate him down to 2 builds

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Liverpool doesn't border London

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What are you doing with North Sea then? I was thinking that you could bounce him
out of Denmark

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: lmao just glanced at the borders and went for it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: oh I'm a fool

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'm not sure if I'm in the position to do that. Have you talked to Austria?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: I have talked with Austria

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: How did that go?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Pretty well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Where are they looking to expand?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think they mostly just want to take neutral supply centers like Serbia for now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Okay. I am leaning toward biding my time and grabbing Sweden later

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I am not going to make enemies of a 3 build Germany, but I won't help them attack
you rn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Even if they get bounced down to two, I'm harming my own interests

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'll move to Munich if you move to Denmark

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Deal.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds great

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
england: Alright I'll be bouncing Denmark. Germany thinks we're going to form a loose
3-way alliance for a few turns

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
england: I had to justify not going NC somehow

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: EC**

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Cool. I'm headed to Munich- if these both work you will be in an especially strong
position to start capitalizing on Germany's lack of fleet power.


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What gives? I understand that you wanted to get Germany and I into a war without
participating, but honestly what you risk at this point is me and Germany working things
out and attacking you. Is there any reason that I should not just do that?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I don't want to fight you since I find it incredibly easy for both of us to defend
against eachother.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello and apologies. Considering that both of you are rather powerful with your
early builds, I didn't want to overcommit to one side before I knew I could reasonably
trust in my own safety. As such, I not move turn 1 EC against you, and I didn't move into
Denmark.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I realize that might be exceptionally frustrating, but hopefully you understand
why I might be incredibly cautious with only one build.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: That said, I had a lot more to lose in this situation than you. Now that I know I
can trust you in our efforts against Germany, I would be more than willing to use my navy
to help your cause.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That's great to hear, but I need an actual commitment. I'd like to see you build
fleet Edinburgh (or an army). I'd also really like to see English Channel move to the
North Sea.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: The problem is you lied last turn about bouncing Denmark when you could have told
the truth. That's not a good look, whatever your reasons were.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: That's valid. I can understand why you'd hesitate to trust me. I will comply with
the above requests, and we can decide what to do from there.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thanks. As a heads up I do intend to build fleets, but if you follow through they
can be used to attack Italy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alrighty

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any knowledge of German orders/builds? What have they told you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Nothing super interesting. They want me to go into Brest while they attack. I'll
try to find out more for ya


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds great. Just as a heads up, Germany has been telling me that he would send
his fleet in Holland to North Sea if I withdrew from Munich. Probably a lie, but thought
I'd mention it.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm very close with Russia in terms of our relationship, and I just realized that
you and Russia can take Denmark from Germany this turn. Is that something you are
interested in? I would definitely ask Russia if they can support you into Denmark in the
fall when you are in the North Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Also, any thoughts on how I might keep Munich? Just looking to get a second
opinion on things.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Like if you falsely claim Russia wants to move west this turn

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I shall talk to Russia, and I don't know how you'd keep Munich but perhaps some
sort of deception regarding Russia's goals may work

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Great idea! Yeah I'll try to see if that misinformation can be spread

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah I think Russia is moving to Silesia (wink, wink 😉)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Oh no! If only there were an army in Munich willing to help out!


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm very happy to see your moves. Whild convoying London to Denmark is tempting, I
think it makes the most sense to send Skaggerak to Denmark for two reasons.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Firstly, Russia is the only thing preventing Turkey and Austria from rapid
expansion, which is something we need to prevent in case either of them get in a dominant
position in the east to the point of soloing, or being too big to take out in the future.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Secondly, a fleet in Denmark can support a fleet from the North Sea into the
Helgoland Blight, which is important in case Holland tries to bounce that move. Getting
that fleet there is necessary if we hope to take Holland or Kiel in the future.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: By the way, pretty much everything I've told Germany this turn is a lie. Just so
you know

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Can you move your Brest fleet down south? I'd prefer not to leave my backdoor
unlocked, and nothing I have will be able to capitalize on that. That said, I'll be moving
into Denmark

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Are you comfortable if it goes to Picardy again? I want to try and corner Belgium.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Germany is insisting that you told him that you'd attack me next, which is
concerning since I am a logical target, and it's "pretty much everything" is a lie

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Depends.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Look. You helped me out a ton last turn my moving out of the English Channel and
building the fleet in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Germany built 2 armies, used them against me
to take a dot from me (I have a disband this turn), and tried to take Picardy. I'm not
going to forget that.  I'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it
is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the
future either. Germany is the largest threat to me right now, and I can't overextend
against you without worrying about Italy who has a fleet in Rome (which can only move
West).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Not to mention. You have a build coming and I have a disband. There's no chance I
can win in a fight against you. Germany is trying to show discord between us because he
knows it's the only chance he has to survive if we start working together. And for the
record, I told him I'd be attacking you right now *if and only if* he gives me Belgium
(this is a lie, but I'm hoping that I can snag Belgium this turn). I did not say anything
about attacking you after splitting up Germany (and in general I like to deal with the
present situation instead of making long-term plans, since the board is constantly
changing).  I'll be around to talk more later today, but hopefully that assuaged some of
your fears

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Okay. I will continue to support you against Germany. However, I will only accept
Brest into Picardy if MAO moves south. You have other things to worry about, but I'm not
going to open up my coasts without an insurance policy. I will move into Denmark, ideally
with Russian support, and we can see how the situation progresses from there.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: If you maintain our alliance for the duration of the conflict against Germany, I
will surrender Belgium and Holland to you as well

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I will 100% do that if that is what we want to do. I don't mean to push it too
much (as I realize just Picardy is a large trust excersize), but in the interest of full
disclosure, I was initially planning to send MAO to the English Channel. I wanted to put
that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly
there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I
know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in
the channel temporarily. If you do allow that, you would have control over what we do with
that unit- whether that's convoying London to Belgium, cutting Belgium support to try and
capture Holland, or sending it to Belgium with supports from Burgundy and Picardy.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I can see why you'd want MAO in EC. As a compromise, you can keep MAO where it is
instead of moving south, and maybe EC next. Picardy and EC are two big bites, and being
able to take them one at a time would go far in my comfort with that move.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds great! Thanks. Let me know if you find out anything about what Germany
plans to do (I will do the same, but at this point I don't think he'd share any reliable
info with me).

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: Lol Germany is mad at me I don't think I'm gonna get much either

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I can't imagine he is not telling you anything. He has to be telling you
something.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If he's telling you that he will give you Denmark, he is lying. You need to
support yourself to there

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: He offered me Belgium to turn on you thats it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: He hasn't mentioned Denmark

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Interesting.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Do you know what Russia is doing with Sweden?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I asked him to support me into Denmark, but he hasn't been replying so idk if he
will

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah it seems like most of the players are not replying, probably due to the labor
day weekend.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Yeah that makes sense.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Germany thinks I'm going to turn on you for belgium.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Is he giving you Belgium right now?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Is he giving you Belgium right now?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I don't think it's possible for him to give you Belgium unless he makes some wacky
moves into the Helgoland Blight and to Holland

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I don't think he is. He believes it'll be a long term exchange

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: Are you online

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Are you online?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: My connection kind of sucks but I'm here

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: What's up?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Russia was just saying he'd support you to Denmark

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: This changes a lot in terms of plans because one thing you can do now is move
North Sea to Helgoland and Norwegian Sea to North Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: He wants me to send Nor west so idk if that will fly with him.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You'd be able to conviy into Kiel or Holland next Spring and take the other in the
fall for two dots

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah he told me he wanted you to put it in Edinburgh

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'd be fine with that but it's a regressive move. If anything, Russia is just
worried that you'll attack him

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Other option if you want to be safe is we can bounce in the English Channel

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It's slower but we can do all this stuff next year anyway as long as you stay in
North Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm glad since Russia's silence was really worrying me, but it seems like he was
just away for the weekend

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright that sounds good to me. NWG will go to Edi, North Sea can bounce EC, and
Ska will take Denmark.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: And yeah I was worried too but all is well so that's comforting.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Sounds good. Ordered and in

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You may want to move London out of the way since your re going to have a build and
I assume you don't want to build in liverpool

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: That's a marvelous point thanks for mentioning that.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: So Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: We probably should have seen that coming since zRussia does honestly really need
the build to stop Turkey Austria from rolling over him

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Depending on what Russia says you should decide between spending effort to evict
Russia from Norway or letting it go

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Russia said there was a discrepancy between what you're telling and him and what
I told him. What did you communicate to him about my moves?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I just need to find out if he legitimately thought he was in danger or if he
acted with malice.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: We talked a lot and pretty fast, so there is a chance some things got lost in
translation. But basically I just told him we were bouncing in the channel and we had
worked things out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright cool. He went to bed but I'm gonna figure out my move in the morning.


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any ideas on what you want your next steps to be? I don't think Russia stabbed you
from malice. If anything I think we'll see with Russias builds that he does not want to
get into conflict with you

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If it is possible to work through this, we need to start working on attacking
Germany ASAP. Right now it's a clusterfuck and Austria Turkey are going to roll over the
West if we don't work together

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Being deprived of a build really kills my momentum on fighting Germany.  One of
my fleets will go into securing Norway, and i'll also try to move against Germany with one
of my fleets

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Edi will probably end up in the North Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Russia didn't like me having so many fleets near him but he stabbed me so he's
gonna have to deal with it lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If Edi will end up in the North Sea, where is North Sea headed? To Helgoland
Blight?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: NS will go Nor

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Makes sense. I'm assuming you worked it out with Russia since otherwise it would
probably bounce

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: He said he'd vacate Nor so here's hoping lol

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You seem very hesitant to attack either Germany or me. You have to commit to one
side at some point though, or else nobody will make any progress while Turkey starts
decimating the East and soloes.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I would highly recommend letting Russia keep Norway for now because he will need
the units against Turkey, and you can always take Norway back later

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Meanwhile, you have a really good opportunity to take some German centers

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Idk it seems like you aren't worried about Turkey/Austria at all.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You should be very worried. Think about them as an 11 center power. They're going
to roll over Italy and Russia very, very quickly

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It seems like you are so far away, so you don't have to worry about it. But the
truth is that they don't need a single one of your supply centers for one of them to win
the game.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: As far as I can tell, Turkey is the stronger partner and Austria is mostly just
going along with it. I've been trying for the past 2 years to get them to fight
unsuccessfully, though you are welcome to try

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If this pattern continues we will see Turkey stab Austria once the solo is in
sight

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It's so much easier to stop right now rather than later. Or in fact, instead of
stopping it we could just create a stronger counter-alliance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That's why I want Russia to be as strong as possible right now to stop the AT in
their tracks. If you don't want to do that I think we have to hit Germany hard right now.
Maybe you can move to the Helgoland and take Norway in the fall?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: While I reasonably hesitated to involve myself in the conflict with a Germany,
the fact that I have taken Denmark (and intend to continue attacking with the fleet in
Denmark) ought to indicate that I'm no longer hesitating to commit. While Turkey/Austria
is a significant threat in the late game, I'm also concerned with not being eliminated in
the short-term. The fact of the matter is that I am surrounded by powers who can stab me
with devastating effect (you) or powers who have in fact stabbed me (Russia) or would stab
if given the chance (Germany). I am more than willing to hit Germany right now and move
South from Denmark, but I also need to cover my bases and get Nor. Russia can have centers
in Germany to combat AT.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
england: I'm willing to be the weaker power in the interest of countering AT, but I am
inclined to think that holding Denmark and Nor is a very reasonable minimum.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Very fair, thanks for writing out your thoughts. We'll see what happens but you
probably will grow faster than I can. Germany has so many armies that any successful
attack on him hinges on you (and Russia to some extent)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright. Where do you want the Danish fleet to move? Has Russia communicated a
plan with his armies? I'll communicate to Russia that if I have Norway he can take his
picking of German centers to combat AT

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Makes sense to move it to Kiel I think?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Yeah I was thinking actually that it would make sense to put Russia into munich

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Russia disappeared again but hopefully we can work that out

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hey I just told Russia he can keep Nor for now.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I really don't want to have to deal with Turkey pushing up to StP or something

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Awesome! Russia told me he would build an army in Moscow, so if he guesses right
he might be able to keep Turkey out for now


1903, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Everything looks good right now. If you sill plan to let Russia keep Norway then I
would recommend ordering North Sea-Helgoland Blight, Denmark - Kiel, and Edinburgh-North
Sea. Best case scenario, you end up in Helgoland Blight, Kiel, and North Sea and can take
Holland in the fall for a total of both Kiel and Holland

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I recommend this because I believe that Germany trusts you and that he will not
make an attempt to defend Kiel, especially if you tell him that you have your hands full
with Russia and me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I hate to ruin the party but there is no chance in hell that Germany trusts me.
They have fully stopped replying to me.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: That said, I'm sure their hands are full anyway, so I'll move into Kiel

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Oh haha. Well, he isn't talking to me either, so I guess he may have given up 😂

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I need you tell me whether or not the idea I just had is stupid. If Russia trusts
the FER alliance, I could totally convoy army to Livonia and support any of the centers
neighboring it. Is that even worth proposing or should it stay in my head?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Support Russia defending I mean.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It's worth proposing but maybe not at this point since it will take a while to set
up anyway. That's a great idea for the future I think


1903, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: What's your goal with EC?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Literally just to take Belgium- after that it will go south or help you if needed

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright. I'm gonna trust that since conflict among FER is a bad look given AT

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Here's a tentative plan: Kiel-Berlin Bohemia-Munich Silesia S Bohemia-Munich
Burgundy-Ruhr English Channel S Picardy-Belgium Picardy-Belgium Helgoland-Holland North
Sea S Helgoland-Holland

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You have almost nothing to worry about- you can cover London this turn and have a
strong chance to get 2 builds

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You are guaranteed Holland under this tentative plan

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Okay sounds good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: And unless Germany uses Munich or Ruhr to take Kiel (highly unlikely), you'll get
that too

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'll copy this plan to Russia and we can refine it if necessary then

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright. Let me know what Russia's thoughts are

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Will do.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Russia said he liked the plan

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alrighty cool

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Darn. If we knew Germany was submitting all hold orders, we could have eliminated
him this turn! That being said, this is great progress

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Now we should start talking about next steps. I think now would be a good time to
pitch the Livonia thing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any thoughts for builds? Also, any recommendations/requests for my build?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'd love to attack Italy, but I don't want to pull him away from defending
Austria/Turkey. It's hard to say if he'd end up getting very angry and throwing supply
centers to Turkey. It's a delicate balance

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I will talk to Russia about Livonia. I don't think this is a good time to attack
Italy. It would be better for you to support him in the while Russia, presumably with my
support, holds/pushes east. It is also possible for me to send fleets around Iberia into
med to help out with supporting Italy. I will be building armies. My fleets will not be
super useful in the conflict to come, but armies can help russia a lot.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Makes sense. I agree with all of that.


1904, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I sent this to russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I am pretty confident that Austria will support Bohemia to Silesia. For that
reason, I recommend: Warsaw S Silesia H  Munich-Berlin Kiel S Munich-Berlin Burgundy-
Munich

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: New thought: Ukraine-Sevastopol Moscow S Ukraine-Sevastopol Warsaw-Galicia Silesia
S Warsaw-Galicia Munich-Berlin Kiel S Munich-Berlin Burgundy-Munich  This move set has all
of the advantages of both move sets

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Anyway, it wasn't clear whether Russia wanted you to move to Livonia or not after
my conversation with him, but I think it might be worthwhile to convoy to Denmark to set
up for it anyway?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Sorry about the delay I've been in class all morning. I asked Russia and they
were not into it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Ok. That's a tough spot to be in. So what were you planning to do instead?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If you are up for it, I can move to English Channel and Mid Atlantic Ocean, and
then convoy Wales to North Africa.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I know you recommended earlier that I work with Italy, but lately I haven't been
able to get in contact with him. If that continues, I think our best course of action is
moving quickly to try and take those centers before Turkey and Austria do.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I know you are busy- but let's try to nail down a plan before the deadline this
time around.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'll be back around later in the day.

england: I think Italy is a good target if they're not helping the cause

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Have you heard anything new from Russia?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Nothing new or interesting. They want support to kill Germany

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello! Would you like to set up that Naf convoy next turn?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think so. That being said, the timing does feel a little bit off if we do it
now. I also don't really know what the deal is regarding Italy, Austria, and Turkey

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: I really need a build right now, and even though Russia is getting two builds, he
seems reluctant to hand off Munich to me as previously discussed. I wonder if it would be
possible for Kiel to cut Berlin's support in case Russia gets greedy and tries to support
Silesia to Munich?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Are you sure he can't be convinced to surrender it to you? If I hit him in Berlin
that might breakup FER

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Have you talked to Russia about Mun today?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Unfortunately not, as I've been very busy with everything that has been going on.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright based on what he told me he intends to keep it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I can't get a response from him at the moment, but I just told him my intentions
to support myself there.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: In order to keep Munich, Russia would have to use Silesia and support himself to
Munich

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright. Do you need me to do anything or am I chillin?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Kiel to Berlin would be amazing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Thanks for that- it ultimately wasn't necessary. And wow- did not expect to pick
up either Rome and Venice, which actually hurts a lot in terms of containing Italy. I'm
sure Austria and Italy will be attacking me next.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sorry- forgot to add that cutting Berlin makes me even more comfortable than I
already was in swinging the rest of my units towards Italy


1905, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: How do you feel about Russia right now?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Seems like our alliance is getting pretty testy but he hasn't responded since
Berlin so idk for sure

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Well this is awkward

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: If you're willing to cooperate, I would be more than willing to surrender German
centers in exchange for peace.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Besides, stuff like Kie or even NTH makes it look like you and Russia are only
sort of on the same page.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I am more than happy to coordinate- it honestly has been very busy over the past
few days for me so I haven't been able to talk with you or Russia that much.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: There's no getting around it: I need builds to fuel a campaign against Italy and
Turkey in the south. I'm glad you are looking for an opportunity to make this as amicable
as possible- I definitely don't intend on going after the island (hence, sending Brest to
MAO rather than the English Channel). On top of not being necessary, your coasts are
extremely well defended.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: That's the beauty of leaving three armies on the island lol. I'm willing to give
you some builds, but unless I get centers somewhere else that's pretty much the end of my
support for FER simply because I won't have the units to do anything useful.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I *think* the way this can work out is having me take Holland and Russia take
Kiel.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That's totally reasonable- and I think FER may be falling apart soon if Russia and
I can't figure out our differences soon

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: *falling apart soon anyway

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Hello! Sorry about the delay. I'm gonna vacate Hol and Kiel

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: I'd prefer to keep Denmark

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: You can guarantee that you keep it if you move there


1905, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Wow, Russia was not supposed to go to North Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think your chances of survival are best if you get Russia and I to fight right
now: so even though 3 armies is a great defensive position, I might consider keeping Edi
to fan the flames

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I legitimately thought you would bounce me from Denmark (the irony that the only
reason you have this choice is due to losses from Russia and I is not lost on me)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: No worries.


1906, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: So out of curiosity... are you gonna try to take my home centers or can I just
ride this one out?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm not going to try to take your home centers unless I can solo, which is seeming
more and more unlikely with builds that indicate a coalition forming against me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: If it's any consolation you don't have to worry about my participation in a
coalition LMAO

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: If you're interested in getting me out of the channel, I'm moving Channel to North
Sea right now if Edinburgh is free to support that move?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Why do you need that? You have a fleet in NTH don't you?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
france: I don't *need* it per se, but I plan to leave the North Sea and there is a good
chance that Russia may choose to bounce it out with Norwegian Sea.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Alright sounds good


1907, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Do you want support to Norwegian Sea?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Supporting NTH?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: NTH would support Edi to Norwegian Sea

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Nah I'm content to chill in Edi but I'll support you into NWG if you wanna hit
that fleet

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sure

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Are you and Russia gonna work it out?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Unfortunately not.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Instead of holding with all your units, you could always do a "Yorkshire Pudding"
by sending all of your units to Yorkshire

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
england: Oh that's true if I'm gonna sit on this island I'm gonna have a good time while I
do it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
england: Real talk am I deserving of Turkey's flame/

# Sender is truthful, receiver is unknown
england: I don't see what else I could've done with 3 builds

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Turkey is just upset over the game I think

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: If you were going to attack me the time to do it would have been building 2 fleets
instead of 2 armies. But the context of that turn was me agreeing to move out of English
Channel and attack Italy

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: After that you had a significant unit disadvantage

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: We should probably move this conversation away from here now that the game is over

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Hey France! How's things? I think we could do well to work together to share
information of our neighbours. Are you interested at all in this idea? Have you heard from
anyone yet?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I don't have much info right now unfortunately. Our countries definitely
compliment eachother through

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I've heard from Russia and it seemed like he was a solid player and would probably
be a good ally for you. The Russia Turkey alliance is one of the strongest on the board.
As France it would be a natural for me to help you with that as I am on the other side of
the board

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Also, sorry for the weird communication times. I've been in and out since it was a
super busy day today and actually missed some of your questions. I'd love to share as much
info on our neighbors and I've heard from almost everyone

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: No problem at all! On that note, It sounds like Italy may be headed your way. Of
course I can't be sure but that's what he indicated. Whether that's short or mid term I
can't be sure.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Thanks for the heads up- I appreciate it. Any more ideas about your own plans in
the East?


1901, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any new updates on what is going on now that moves have resolved?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Pretty sure Austria and Russia and maybe even Italy are all planning to Roast
Turkey. Given Germany is gifting Sweden and England doesn't look like putting up any
resistance in the North to Russia either, I think the likelihood of a runaway Russia is
rising by the minute 🙂

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: A runaway Russia would not be good for me. Not sure how much I can help though
since I'm on the other side of the board. Maybe you can convince Italy to help you against
Austria by offering them Greece


1901, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Nice work getting Austria on your side

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Russia seems to be well defended but not too strong, so I don't know how much more
you stand to gain from attacking Russia. My honest opinion is that you stand more to gain
from stabbing Austrua

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: (Than continuing to attack Russia)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Thanks yeah its still definitely very dicey down here but hoping to secure my
homelands at least. Nice one nabbing Munich. Not exactly a common goal to achieve in 1901!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any preferences on who you want to work with? It might affect some of my decisions
here.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: There is zero chance I keep Munich, so really what it does is slow down Germany
temporarily from running everyone over with 3 builss


1902, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Russia and Austria could potentially be attacking you since Rumania is an easy
picking. Hopefully one of them is a strong ally?

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Actually, maybe not, since I think Russia is helping me against Germany by moving
to Silesia


1902, Fall:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Looks like I had bad information, which is too bad since I will be losing Munich

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Are you still working with Austria? Your moves were especially clever so it looks
like you will take Sevastopol, but it seems like you may have a tough time expanding much
further than that. You might stall out.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yes maybe but there is still options for work g with Austria. Shame about Munich
but I think you're still in a pretty good position. Germany looks to be in a bit of
trouble with both you and England threatening

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Its a position with next to no growth potential unfortunately. We'll see what
happens. It seems that both Austria and Russia are willing to work with you

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Do you have any Intel on Germany or England?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Do you have any Intel on Germany or England?


1902, Winter:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: What are you building?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sorry for my lack of communication - been busy here. I'm leaning towards a fleet
at this stage. I don't have anything on England and Germany - Germany says they are tied
up and suggest I go after Russia - both things are not going to enlighten anyone who is
looking at the board right now. He doesn't seem particularly concerned with his situation
but I may be reading too much into that. Looks pretty scary for him right now with Russia
on his doorstep as well as you and England circling.


1903, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Interesting to see your progress in positioning against Italy. At some point,
maybe we can start talking about what the long term on that front looks like?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I wonder if it makes sense for you to actually work with Italy here to stab
Austria.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: I can't really see it. If you want, hit tys again this year and I can support you
into tun next year in return

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I marked that as a lie because I think you CAN see it. You and Italy could have
stabbed Austria for 3 supply centers last turn.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: What I can see is a good relationship between you and Italy, a wintergreen from
the beginning and a spot for me as the third wheel in that. Not the most amazing
opportunity but maybe I'm missing something

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: That's the case if you're trying to top the board, but the way we're paid it
doesn't matter if you have 17 supply centers or 1

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: It's not a ton of difference in terms of payment honestly. But if you can
eliminate somebody without being eliminated yourself, I'd say that you'd be better off (in
general)

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I'm in it for the competition and to win.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: But, think about all the things you could buy with $2 Amazon credit 🤣!

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Lol good point! I should reassess my priorities 😬

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Well whats your plans now - North or East? If you want to go East, I'm here.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: ...to help

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I think I might be mostly positioning myself for the future to remain flexible


1904, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: How about you? Are you still committed to playing the slow grind with Austria? I'm
sure you are already aware of this, but we do end the game in winter of 1910.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
turkey: Yup just going to grind it out. Russia wants to get me. That's his sole mission in
this game. Attacking Austria isnt going to help defend against them.


1904, Fall:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Looks like Austria was convinced to work with Russia? I wonder if your plan is to
try and make up with Austria or not.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: The German NMR gifting the west annd Russia centers and now Englands moves have
written this game off in my opinion.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I get where you are coming from, but I hope you stick it out. I think you've
forgotten that your loyal ally France has come to save the day!


1905, Spring:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: So, what are your plans now? I don't want to fight you over the Ionian

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Just going through the motions - happy to do whatever you like really - just let
me know

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: However, one thing I would ask is that you hit NAP with ROM. I just want to
survive, so I need to keep Austria out of ADR. Otherwise, my units are at your service 🙂
Just don't let Russia win please.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good. I will definitely be keeping an eye on Russia

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Austria is already in the Adriatic Sea unfortunately though

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sorry I meant the ION

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: So do you think I'm allied with Italy or something? You basically have done the
opposite to everything I've asked in relation them which is... strange. You'd have had nap
now if you followed through.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: You are obviously not allied with Italy. I don't want you to feel like you are
being ignored- but ultimately I decided to make the moves that I thought would be best to
help me hold onto what I currently have of Italy. A better way for me to handle things
would have been to give you a heads up beforehand (for which I apologize). That being
said, we would be having a different conversation had I made an explicit commitment
towards moving to Naples. And in terms of results, I think you are actually the greatest
beneficiary of the moves from last spring, so there is also that 😂 .

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Still there?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Nice work on the build by the way.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I agree that you should defend Greece. Any thoughts on what you want to do about
your fleet in Tunis though? Maybe we can organize a swap for Naples?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Sounds fair to me

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: And btw my message about Greece was sent last season but I forgot to give it the
thumbs up so it didn't go through.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: I messed that season up though - had to just let Russia into Sev with his army so
he couldn't build there and I could've taken the Black Sea


1906, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Looks like Russia failed to build in Sev anyway 🙂. What's your relationship with
Austria?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: That is handy. Pretty good overall although he's been quiet lately. He stabbed me
but then Russia immediately attacked him so I'm sure we can work something out.

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: He's angry at me- so not sure how helpful he will be against Russia. I bet Austria
will be taking supply centers from me this turn.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Nice moves-except for the Austrian hold in Budapest, which means that Rumania was
not taken :(


1906, Fall:

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I'm supporting your fleet in Tyrhenian to Naples as per our earlier agreement to
swap Tunis for Naples.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Any idea what the deal is regarding Russia/Austria? I imagine that Austria and
Russia plan to take a couple dots off of me this turn

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: I think the point where I stop making any progress is coming up very soon, so I'd
love to start talking about ways this plays out to a draw

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: thoughts? The bot was down for a short bit

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Are you moving to Naples?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Yes, and thanks for the support into it

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: sorry, been out for a bit

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Sounds good. No worries

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: I was floating the idea of a 3 way draw between you, Russia, and I, since it would
make sense if we pulled it off correctly.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Up to you guys really. I will probably just try and be a pain for whoever is
getting close to the solo by helping the other. I would therefore be happy to take the
draw instead.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: Looks like you should be able to take it out anyway though. Russia has been
playing some sub-par moves so the solo is there for you to take.

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: With the English freebies its pretty much done.


1906, Winter:
----
# Sender is deceitful, receiver is doubting
france: There's no solo in sight right now

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Probably makes sense to build an army for you I would think. We're stalemated in
the Mediterranean anyway

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: I'm building an army in Marseilles for example


1907, Spring:
----
# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: What do you mean there's no solo in sight? lol you're on 15 and there are three
free centres in England... I might not be paying much attention to this game but I'd have
to be blind and dumb not to see that. Even if there weren't freebies there you could get
them elsewhere. You'd have to try harder not to solo from here haha

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Sure, it's definitely possible. That being said, I also think it would be
inconvenient to take English supply Centers due to the density of those units

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Regarding the three way, the best way to do it would probably be to force Austria
off the map this turn. Maybe Bulgaria-Serbia with support from Rumania while Russia
supports Galicia to Budapest?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: The only issue would be a retreat to Greece or Albania, so it might be worthwhile
to bounce in Albania with Greece and Ion to prevent any retreats

# Sender is deceitful, receiver is believing
france: Interesting, I didn't mean to take Naples- I figured you might cut the Tyrhenian
Sea's support. I'll move out if we can call a truce in Trieste?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: Interesting choice to move to Albania as it means that Turkey can retreat to
Greece

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
france: *Austria can retreat to Greece

# Sender is truthful, receiver is believing
turkey: This game is over, spending more than 2 minutes per season is a waste of time. I'm
glad you found the moves interesting though! I cant stop laughing at "I didn't mean to
take Naples". In my experience, the best way not to take something is to not attack it.
That's just what I've found but I guess you've got other methods of not taking something
haha, of course you meant to take Naples and of course we both know that this game has
been over for a few seasons. It's all the same at this point. Good game, well played. If
you're trying to rack up lies with me I wouldn't bother. I have to conclude that that's
the only point for all of them the last few seasons or is it just for fun? If its just for
fun, carry on, I dont mind. If its for the successful lie counter, Russia is a better
option for that I think?

# Sender is truthful, receiver is doubting
france: Well. I was trying to get you to not take Trieste in the fall. I can support it to
hold, but I suspect that if you and Russia are coordinating, Vienna would cut Tyrolia's
support.
